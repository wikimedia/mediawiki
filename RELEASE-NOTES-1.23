Security reminder: MediaWiki does not require PHP's register_globals. If you
have it on, turn it '''off''' if you can.

== MediaWiki 1.23 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.23 is an alpha-quality branch and is not recommended for use in
production.

=== Configuration changes in 1.23 ===
* $wgDebugLogGroups values may be set to an associative array with a
  'destination' key specifying the log destination. The array may also contain
  a 'sample' key with a positive integer value N indicating that the log group
  should be sampled by dispatching one in every N messages on average. The
  sampling is random.
* In addition to the current exception log format, MediaWiki now serializes
  exception metadata to JSON and logs it to the 'exception-json' log group.
  This makes MediaWiki easier to integrate with log aggregation and analysis
  tools.
* $wgSquidServersNoPurge now supports the use of Classless Inter-Domain
  Routing (CIDR) notation to specify contiguous blocks of IPv4 and/or IPv6
  addresses that should be trusted to provide X-Forwarded-For headers.
* Preferences 'watchcreations' and 'watchdefault' ("Add pages I create and files
  I upload to my watchlist", "Add pages and files I edit to my watchlist") are
  now enabled by default.

=== New features in 1.23 ===
* ResourceLoader can utilize the Web Storage API to cache modules client-side.
  Compared to the browser cache, caching in Web Storage allows ResourceLoader
  to be more granular about evicting stale modules from the cache while
  retaining the ability to retrieve multiple modules in a single HTTP request.
  This capability can be enabled by setting $wgResourceLoaderStorageEnabled to
  true. This feature is currently considered experimental and should only be
  enabled with care.
* (bug 6092) Add expensive parser functions {{REVISIONID:}}, {{REVISIONUSER:}}
  and {{REVISIONTIMESTAMP:}} (with friends).
* Add "wgRelevantUserName" to mw.config containing the current
  Skin::getRelevantUser value.
* (bug 56033) Add content model to the page information.
* Added Article::MissingArticleConditions hook to give extensions a chance to
  hide their (unrelated) log entries.
* Added $wgOpenSearchDefaultLimit defining the default number of entries to show
  on action=opensearch API call.
* For namespaces with $wgNamespaceProtection (including the MediaWiki
  namespace), the "protect" tab will be shown only if there are restriction
  levels available that would restrict editing beyond what
  $wgNamespaceProtection already applies. The protection form will offer only
  those protection levels.
* Added $wgAPIFormatModules, allowing extensions to add additional output
  formatting modules for the API.
* (bug 47812) The MediaWiki:Group-user.{css,js} pages can now be used to add
  custom CSS or JavaScript enabled only for registered users.
* (bug 52005) Special pages RecentChanges, RecentChangesLinked and Watchlist
  now include a legend describing the symbols used in lists of changes.
* Improved the accessibility of the tabs in Special:Preferences.
* Added ApiBeforeMain hook, roughly equivalent to the BeforeInitialize hook:
  it's called after everything is set up but before any major processing
  happens.

=== Bug fixes in 1.23 ===
* (bug 41759) The "updated since last visit" markers (on history pages, recent
  changes and watchlist) and the talk page message indicator are now correctly
  updated when the user is viewing old revisions of pages, instead of always
  acting as if the latest revision was being viewed.
* (bug 56443) Special:ConfirmEmail no longer shows a "Mail a confirmation code"
  when the email address is already confirmed. Also, consistently use
  "confirmed", rather than "authenticated", when messaging whether or not the
  user has confirmed an email address.
* (bug 56912) Show correct link color on cached result of Special:DeadendPages.
* Classes TitleListDependency and TitleDependency have been removed, as they
  have been found unused in core and extensions for a long time.
* (bug 57098) SpecialPasswordReset now obeys returnto parameter
* (bug 37812) ResourceLoader will notice when a module's definition changes and
  recompile it accordingly.
* (bug 57201) SpecialRecentChangesFilters hook is now executed for feeds.

=== API changes in 1.23 ===
* (bug 54884) action=parse&prop=categories now indicates hidden and missing
  categories.
* action=query&meta=filerepoinfo now returns additional information for each
  repo.
* EditPage::spamPage() was deprecated since 1.17 and has been removed.
* action=parse&prop=languageshtml was deprecated in 1.18 and will be removed in
  MediaWiki 1.24.
* action=parse now has disabletoc flag to disable table of contents in output.
* SpecialRecentChanges::feedSetup() was removed.
* (bug 25702) list=allcategories, list=allimages, list=alllinks, list=allpages,
  list=deletedrevs and list=filearchive did not handle case-sensitivity
  properly for all parameters.
* ApiQueryBase::titlePartToKey allows an extra parameter that indicates the
  namespace in order to properly capitalize the title part.

=== Languages updated in 1.23 ===

MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated
regularly. Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as
changes to languages because of Bugzilla reports.

* Support was added for Northern Luri (lrc)

=== Other changes in 1.23 ===
* The rc_type field in the recentchanges table has been superseded by a new
  rc_source field.  The rc_source field is a string representation of the
  change type where rc_type was a numeric constant.  This field is not yet
  queried but will be in a future point release of 1.22.
** Utilize update.php to create and populate this new field.  On larger wiki's
   which do not wish to update recentchanges table in one large update please
   review the sql and comments in maintenance/archives/patch-rc_source.sql.
** The rc_type field of recentchanges will be deprecated in a future point
   release.
* The global variable $wgArticle has been removed after a lengthy deprecation.
* The global functions addButton and insertTags (for mw.toolbar.addButton and
  mw.toolbar.insertTags) now emits mw.log.warn when accessed.
* User::getPageRenderingHash() was deprecated since 1.17 and has been removed.
* The ExpandTemplates extension has been moved into MediaWiki core.
* (bug 52812) Removed "Disable search suggestions" from Preference.
* (bug 52809) Removed "Disable browser page caching" from Preference.

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.23 requires PHP 5.3.2 or later.

MySQL is the recommended DBMS. PostgreSQL or SQLite can also be used, but
support for them is somewhat less mature. There is experimental support for
Oracle.

The supported versions are:

* MySQL 5.0.2 or later
* PostgreSQL 8.3 or later
* SQLite 3.3.7 or later
* Oracle 9.0.1 or later

== Upgrading ==

1.23 has several database changes since 1.22, and will not work without schema
updates. Note that due to changes to some very large tables like the revision
table, the schema update may take quite long (minutes on a medium sized site,
many hours on a large site).

If upgrading from before 1.11, and you are using a wiki as a commons
repository, make sure that it is updated as well. Otherwise, errors may arise
due to database schema changes.

If upgrading from before 1.7, you may want to run refreshLinks.php to ensure
new database fields are filled with data.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, you should upgrade to
1.5 first. The upgrade script maintenance/upgrade1_5.php has been removed
with MediaWiki 1.21.

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.

For notes on 1.21.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.
