Security reminder: MediaWiki does not require PHP's register_globals. If you
have it on, turn it '''off''' if you can.

== MediaWiki 1.23 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.23 is an alpha-quality branch and is not recommended for use in
production.

=== Configuration changes in 1.23 ===
* $wgSquidServersNoPurge now supports the use of Classless Inter-Domain
  Routing (CIDR) notation to specify contiguous blocks of IPv4 and/or IPv6
  addresses that should be trusted to provide X-Forwarded-For headers.

=== New features in 1.23 ===
* ResourceLoader can utilize the Web Storage API to cache modules client-side.
  Compared to the browser cache, caching in Web Storage allows ResourceLoader
  to be more granular about evicting stale modules from the cache while
  retaining the ability to retrieve multiple modules in a single HTTP request.
  This capability can be enabled by setting $wgResourceLoaderStorageEnabled to
  true. This feature is currently considered experimental and should only be
  enabled with care.

=== Bug fixes in 1.23 ===
* (bug 41759) The "updated since last visit" markers (on history pages, recent
  changes and watchlist) and the talk page message indicator are now correctly
  updated when the user is viewing old revisions of pages, instead of always
  acting as if the latest revision was being viewed.

=== API changes in 1.23 ===

=== Languages updated in 1.23===

MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated
regularly. Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as
changes to languages because of Bugzilla reports.

=== Other changes in 1.23 ===

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.23 requires PHP 5.3.2 or later.

MySQL is the recommended DBMS. PostgreSQL or SQLite can also be used, but
support for them is somewhat less mature. There is experimental support for
Oracle.

The supported versions are:

* MySQL 5.0.2 or later
* PostgreSQL 8.3 or later
* SQLite 3.3.7 or later
* Oracle 9.0.1 or later

== Upgrading ==

1.23 has several database changes since 1.22, and will not work without schema
updates. Note that due to changes to some very large tables like the revision
table, the schema update may take quite long (minutes on a medium sized site,
many hours on a large site).

If upgrading from before 1.11, and you are using a wiki as a commons
repository, make sure that it is updated as well. Otherwise, errors may arise
due to database schema changes.

If upgrading from before 1.7, you may want to run refreshLinks.php to ensure
new database fields are filled with data.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, you should upgrade to
1.5 first. The upgrade script maintenance/upgrade1_5.php has been removed
with MediaWiki 1.21.

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.

For notes on 1.21.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.
