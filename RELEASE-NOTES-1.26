Security reminder: If you have PHP's register_globals option set, you must
turn it off. MediaWiki will not work with it enabled.

== MediaWiki 1.26 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.26 is an alpha-quality branch and is not recommended for use in
production.

=== Configuration changes in 1.26 ===

=== New features in 1.26 ===
* Change tags can now be hidden in the interface by disabling the associated
  "tag-<id>" interface message.

==== External libraries ====

=== Bug fixes in 1.26 ===
* (bug 51283) load.php sometimes sends 304 response without full headers

=== Action API changes in 1.26 ===
* API action=query&list=tags: The displayname can now be boolean false if the
  tag is meant to be hidden from user interfaces.
* action=import no longer allows both the namespace= and rootpage= parameters
  to be set. If they are both set, the value of rootpage= will be ignored.
* prop=revision output in enum mode is now sorted by timestamp rather than
  revision ID. This usually won't make any difference.

=== Action API internal changes in 1.26 ===

=== Languages updated in 1.26 ===

MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated
regularly. Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as
changes to languages because of Bugzilla reports.


=== Other changes in 1.26 ===
* ChangeTags::tagDescription() will return false if the interface message
  for the tag is disabled.
* Added PageHistoryPager::doBatchLookups hook.
* supportsDirectEditing and supportsDirectApiEditing methods added to
ContentHandler, to provide a way for ApiEditPage and EditPage to check
if direct editing of content is allowed. These methods return false,
by default for the ContentHandler base class and true for TextContentHandler
and it's derivative classes (everything in core). For Content types that
do not support direct editing, an alternative mechanism should be provided
for editing, such as action overrides or specific api modules.

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.26 requires PHP 5.3.3 or later. There is experimental support for
HHVM 3.3.0.

MySQL is the recommended DBMS. PostgreSQL or SQLite can also be used, but
support for them is somewhat less mature. There is experimental support for
Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server.

The supported versions are:

* MySQL 5.0.3 or later
* PostgreSQL 8.3 or later
* SQLite 3.3.7 or later
* Oracle 9.0.1 or later
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 (9.00.1399)

== Upgrading ==

1.26 has several database changes since 1.25, and will not work without schema
updates. Note that due to changes to some very large tables like the revision
table, the schema update may take quite long (minutes on a medium sized site,
many hours on a large site).

If upgrading from before 1.11, and you are using a wiki as a commons
repository, make sure that it is updated as well. Otherwise, errors may arise
due to database schema changes.

If upgrading from before 1.7, you may want to run refreshLinks.php to ensure
new database fields are filled with data.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, you should upgrade to
1.5 first. The upgrade script maintenance/upgrade1_5.php has been removed
with MediaWiki 1.21.

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.

For notes on 1.25.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

== Online documentation ==

Documentation for both end-users and site administrators is available on
MediaWiki.org, and is covered under the GNU Free Documentation License (except
for pages that explicitly state that their contents are in the public domain):

== Mailing list ==

A mailing list is available for MediaWiki user support and discussion:

	https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-l

A low-traffic announcements-only list is also available:

	https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-announce

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.

== IRC help ==

There's usually someone online in #mediawiki on irc.freenode.net.
