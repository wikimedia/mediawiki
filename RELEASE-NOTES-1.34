== MediaWiki 1.34.0-PRERELEASE ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.34 is an alpha-quality development branch, and is not recommended
for use in production.

== Upgrading notes for 1.34 ==
1.34 has several database changes since 1.33, and will not work without schema
updates. Note that due to changes to some very large tables like the revision
table, the schema update may take quite long (minutes on a medium sized site,
many hours on a large site).

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions, including
important information when upgrading from versions prior to 1.11.

Some specific notes for MediaWiki 1.34 upgrades are below:

* …

For notes on 1.33.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

=== Configuration changes for system administrators in 1.34 ===

==== New configuration ====
* $wgAllowExternalReqID (T201409) - This configuration setting controls whether
  Mediawiki accepts the request ID set by the incoming request via the
  `X-Request-Id` header. If set to `true`, that value will be used throughout
  the code as the request identificator. Otherwise, the sent header will be
  ignored and the request ID will either be taken from Apache's mod_unique
  module or will be generated by Mediawiki itself (depending on the set-up).
* $wgEnableSpecialMute (T218265) - This configuration controls whether
  Special:Mute is available and whether to include a link to it on emails
  originating from Special:Email.

==== Changed configuration ====
* $wgUseCdn, $wgCdnServers, $wgCdnServersNoPurge, and $wgCdnMaxAge – These four
  CDN-related config variables have been renamed from being specific to Squid –
  they were previously $wgUseSquid, $wgSquidServers, $wgSquidServersNoPurge, and
  $wgSquidMaxage respectively. This aligns them with the related existing
  variable $wgCdnMaxageLagged. The previous configuration variable names are
  deprecated, but will be used as the fall back if they are still set.
  Note that wgSquidPurgeUseHostHeader has not been renamed, as it is deprecated.
* (T27707) File type checks for image uploads have been relaxed to allow files
  containing some HTML markup in metadata. As a result, the $wgAllowTitlesInSVG
  setting is no longer applied and is now always true. Note that MSIE 7 may
  still be able to misinterpret certain malformed PNG files as HTML.
* Introduced $wgVerifyMimeTypeIE to allow disabling the MSIE 6/7 file type
  detection heuristic on upload, which is more conservative than the checks
  that were changed above.
* …

==== Removed configuration ====
* $wgWikiDiff2MovedParagraphDetectionCutoff — If you still want a custom change
  size threshold, please specify in php.ini, using the configuration variable
  wikidiff2.moved_paragraph_detection_cutoff.
* $wgDebugPrintHttpHeaders - The default of including HTTP headers in the
  debug log channel is no longer configurable. The debug log itself remains
  configurable via $wgDebugLogFile.

=== New user-facing features in 1.34 ===
* Special:Mute has been added as a quick way for users to block unwanted emails
  from other users originating from Special:EmailUser.

=== New developer features in 1.34 ===
* Language::formatTimePeriod now supports the new 'avoidhours' option to output
  strings like "5 days ago" instead of "5 days 13 hours ago".

=== External library changes in 1.34 ===

==== New external libraries ====
* …

==== Removed external libraries ====
* The jquery.async module, deprecated in 1.33, was removed.
* …

=== Bug fixes in 1.34 ===
* (T222529) If a log entry or page revision is recorded in the database with an
  empty username, attempting to display it will log an error and return a "no
  username available" to the user instead of silently displaying nothing or
  invalid links.

=== Action API changes in 1.34 ===
* The 'recenteditcount' response property from action=query list=allusers,
  deprecated in 1.25, has been removed.

=== Action API internal changes in 1.34 ===
* …

=== Languages updated in 1.34 ===
MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated regularly.
Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as changes to languages
because of Phabricator reports.

* (T152908) Added language support for N'Ko (nqo).

=== Breaking changes in 1.34 ===
* The global functions wfSuppressWarnings and wfRestoreWarnings, deprecated in
  1.26, have been removed. Use Wikimedia\AtEase\AtEase::suppressWarnings() and
  Wikimedia\AtEase\AtEase::restoreWarnings() directly.
* Preferences class, deprecated in 1.31, has been removed.
* The following parts of code, deprecated in 1.32, were removed in favor of
  built-in PHP functions:
  * CryptRand class
  * CryptRand service
  * Functions of the MWCryptRand class: singleton(), wasStrong() and generate().
* Language::setCode, deprecated in 1.32, was removed. Use Language::factory to
  create a new Language object with a different language code.
* MWNamespace::clearCaches() has been removed.  So has the $rebuild parameter
  to MWNamespace::getCanonicalNamespaces(), which was deprecated since 1.31.
  Instead, reset services, such as by calling $this->overrideMwServices() (if
  your test extends MediaWikiTestCase). Services will generally not pick up
  configuration changes from after they were created, so you must reset
  services after any configuration change. Even if your code works now, it is
  likely to break in future versions as more code is moved to services.
* The ill-defined "DatabaseOraclePostInit" hook has been removed.
* PreferencesFormLegacy and PreferencesForm classes, deprecated in 1.32, have
  been removed.
* ObjectFactory class, deprecated in 1.31, has been removed.

  This behavior was removed, and the method now matches the parent signature
  (SpecialPage::execute) which is to return HTML string or void.
  To obtain the destination title, use RedirectSpecialPage::getRedirect.
* The 'recenteditcount' response property from action API action=query
  list=allusers, deprecated in 1.25, has been removed.
* SearchEngine::userNamespaces(), SearchEngine::namespacesAsText(),
  SearchEngine::create(), SearchEngine::getSearchTypes() and

  both deprecated in 1.32, have been removed.
* BaseTemplate::msgHtml() and QuickTemplate::msgHtml(), deprecated in 1.32, have
  been removed. Use ->msg() or ->getMsg() instead.

=== Deprecations in 1.34 ===
* The MWNamespace class is deprecated. Use NamespaceInfo.
* ExtensionRegistry->load() is deprecated, as it breaks dependency checking.
  Instead, use ->queue().
* User::isBlocked() is deprecated since it does not tell you if the user is
  blocked from editing a particular page. Use User::getBlock() or
  PermissionManager::isBlockedFrom() or PermissionManager::userCan() instead.
* User::isLocallyBlockedProxy and User::inDnsBlacklist are deprecated and moved
  to the BlockManager as private helper methods.
* User::isDnsBlacklisted is deprecated. Use BlockManager::isDnsBlacklisted
  instead.
* The Config argument to ChangesListSpecialPage::checkStructuredFilterUiEnabled
  is deprecated. Pass only the User argument.
* WatchedItem::getUser is deprecated. Use getUserIdentity.

  RevisionLookup::getPreviousRevision and RevisionLookup::getNextRevision.
* The Title parameter to RevisionLookup::getPreviousRevision and
  RevisionLookup::getNextRevision is deprecated and should be omitted.
* MWHttpRequest::factory is deprecated. Use HttpRequestFactory.
* The Http class is deprecated. For the request, get, and post methods, use
  HttpRequestFactory. For isValidURI, use MWHttpRequest::isValidURI.  For
  getProxy, use (string)$wgHTTPProxy. For createMultiClient, construct a
  MultiHttpClient directly.
* Http::$httpEngine is deprecated and has no replacement. The default 'guzzle'
  engine will eventually be made the only engine for HTTP requests.
* RepoGroup::singleton(), RepoGroup::destroySingleton(),
  RepoGroup::setSingleton(), wfFindFile(), and wfLocalFile() are all
  deprecated. Use MediaWikiServices instead.

* The Block class is separated into DatabaseBlock (for blocks stored in the
  database), and SystemBlock (for temporary blocks created by the system).
  SystemBlock should be used when creating any temporary blocks. Block is
  a deprecated alias for DatabaseBlock.
* Parser::$mConf is deprecated. It will be removed entirely in a later version.
  Some context can be found at T224165.
* Constructing Parser directly is deprecated. Obtain one from ParserFactory.
* Title::moveSubpages is deprecated. Use MovePage::moveSubpages or

  been deprecated. Inside ResourceLoaderModule subclasses, use the local methods
  instead. Elsewhere, use the methods from the ResourceLoader class.

  instead.
* Sanitizer::attributeWhitelist() and Sanitizer::setupAttributeWhitelist()
  have been deprecated; they will be made private in the future.
* SearchResult::termMatches() method is deprecated. It was unreliable because
  only populated by few search engine implementations. Use
  SqlSearchResult::getTermMatches() if really needed.
* SearchResult::getTextSnippet( $terms ) the $terms param is being deprecated
  and should no longer be passed. Search engine implemenations should be
  responsible for carrying relevant information needed for highlighting with
  their own SearchResultSet/SearchResult sub-classes.
* SearchEngine::$searchTerms protected field is deprecated. Moved to
  SearchDatabase.
* The use of the $terms param in the ShowSearchHit and ShowSearchHitTitle
  hooks is highly discouraged as it's only populated by SearchDatabase search
  engines.

  template option 'searchaction' instead.
