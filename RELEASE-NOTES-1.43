== MediaWiki 1.43.0-PRERELEASE ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.43 is an alpha-quality development branch, and is not recommended
for use in production.

== Upgrading notes for 1.43 ==
Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed per-version upgrade instructions from the
oldest supported upgrading version, MediaWiki 1.35.

Some specific notes for MediaWiki 1.43 upgrades are below:

* It is now necessary that the OpenSSL PHP extension is installed.
* …

For notes on 1.42.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

=== Configuration changes for system administrators in 1.43 ===

* $wgBlockTargetMigrationStage, which was introduced in 1.42, is now deprecated
  and has no effect.
* …

==== New configuration ====

* (T13555) $wgParserEnableLegacyHeadingDOM - Defaults to `true`, can be set to
  `false` to enable new, more accessible HTML markup for wikitext headings.
  Note that each skin must also use the 'supportsMwHeading' option to allow it.
  More information: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Heading_HTML_changes
  In a future release the new markup will become the default,
  and later this option will be removed.
* …

==== Changed configuration ====

* wgPageLinksSchemaMigrationStage – (T299947) This temporary setting, which
  controls the database schema migration for the page links table, is now set
  by default to write to both old and new data and read from the new data.
* The "error-json" channel, configurable via $wgDebugLogGroups, has been
  removed. For structured logging, use the "error" channel directly instead.
  Since MediaWiki 1.25, structured logging is supported via Monolog for all
  channels, including the "error" channel. For silenced errors, you use the
  "silenced-error" channel added in MediaWiki 1.42. (T193472)
* …

==== Removed configuration ====

* wgSessionInsecureSecrets has been removed since OpenSSL is now a required
  PHP extension.
* $wgTemplateLinksSchemaMigrationStage has been removed.
* …

=== New user-facing features in 1.43 ===

* (T338341) Support reading XMP and EXIF from WebP files
* (T242346) Special:TalkPage is a new special page that will redirect to the
  associated talk namespace page, e.g. [[Special:TalkPage/Foo]] redirects to
  [[Talk:Foo]]; [[Special:TalkPage/Project:Foo]] goes to [[Project talk:Foo]].
  This allows for links by templates and tools without having to parse what
  namespaces are valid and have associated talk pages.
* …

=== New features for sysadmins in 1.43 ===

* …

=== New developer features in 1.43 ===

* StatusValue class gained new method getMessages(): MessageSpecifier[],
  allowing the errors to be inspected and displayed more easily, for example:
    foreach ( $status->getMessages() as $msg ) {
      if ( $msg->getKey() !== 'ignored-message' ) {
        $this->getOutput()->addWikiMsg( $msg );
      }
    }
* The REST API framework now supports defining redirects in route definition
  files. See MediaWiki\Rest\Handler\RedirectHandler for details.
* (T13555) Skins can enable the 'supportsMwHeading' option for new, more
  accessible HTML markup for wikitext headings. MediaWiki's own styles and
  scripts have been updated to support it, but your skin may also need updates.
  More information: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Heading_HTML_changes
  A future release will emit deprecation warnings for skins with
  'supportsMwHeading' set to false.
* (T219397) New `Language::formatDurationBetweenTimestamps()` function added
  which takes two timestamps and a precision in order to calculate a more
  accurate text representation of duration.
* …

  upstream.

=== Breaking changes in 1.43 ===

* ErrorPageError public properties 'msg' and 'title' may now contain
  any MessageSpecifier object, not just Message.
* Reset button functionality suppressReset() and $mShowReset from HTMLForm
  was removed without replacement.
* UserGroupMembership::getGroupName(), deprecated in 1.38, and
  UserGroupMembership::getGroupMemberName(), deprecated in 1.40, have
  been removed.

  removed.
* Parser::getFreshParser(), deprecated in 1.39, has been removed.
* ConfigFactory::getDefaultInstance(), deprecated since 1.27, has been
  removed.
* IReadableDatabase::getReplicaPos() has been removed without deprecation
  as it's not used anywhere.
* ILoadBalancer::laggedReplicaUsed() has been moved to ILoadBalancerForOwner::
  effectively making it internal.
* Overriding MWException::getHTML(), ::getText(), ::getPageTitle(), and
  ::reportHTML() in order to display custom exception messages is no
  longer supported.
* In PageHandlerTestTrait, the newRouter() method was renamed to
  newRouterForPageHandler() to avoid a conflict with a method of the same
  name in RestTestTrait. Also, PageHandlerTestTrait is no longer marked as
  "stable to use". It was marked this way by accident, the functionality it
  provides is specific to certain handlers implemented in MediaWiki core.
* TablePager::getBody(), final and deprecated since 1.24, has been removed.
  Use ::getBodyOutput() or ::getFullOutput() instead.
* ImportableUploadRevisionImporter::downloadSource(), deprecated in 1.31, is now

  ContributionsSpecialPage. The page passed in is a ContributionsSpecialPage
  type, and documentation and type comparisons may need to be updated. Affected
  hooks are: ContributionsBeforeMainOutputHook, ContributionsToolLinksHook,
  SpecialContributions__getForm__filtersHook.
* Hooks that were run from ContribsPager are now run from the parent,
  ContributionsPager. If a pager is passed in, it is a ContributionsPager type,

  been deprecated in favor of new method StatusValue::getMessages().
* (T166010) All PHP code in MediaWiki is slowly being moved to be in a class
  namespace as appropriate, so that we can use PSR-4 auto-loading, which will
  speed up general code loading of MediaWiki. The old global namespace class
  names are being left behind as deprecated aliases.

* MessageCache::get() with $language other than Language or null is

  ServiceOptions to inject the required options.
* ObjectCache::isDatabaseId() and ::getLocalClusterInstance() have been
  deprecated. Use their equivalents in ObjectCacheFactory.

  a mistake, as the parameters have always been ignored.

  passing MessageSpecifier or MessageValue as $source has been deprecated.
* DatabaseBlock::getQueryInfo() and DatabaseBlock::getRangeCond() are
  deprecated and emit deprecation warnings. Use the equivalent methods in

* …

=== Other changes in 1.43 ===

* Class aliases to support the old PHPUnit 4 style un-namespaced `PHPUnit_`
  classes (such as PHPUnit_Framework_Error) have been removed.
* [Temporary accounts] If $wgAutoCreateTempUser is enabled, then MediaWiki
  will create a temporary account and log the user in for unsuccessful edit
  attempts and null edits, in addition to edits that change content. This is
  a change from the previous paradigm, where temporary accounts were created
  only for successful edits. This change is done to support better logging
  support and moderation, to ensure that hooks run in a pre-save context have
  a user object to associate log entries and other actions with.
* Several entries have been removed from the default list of interwikis used
  when installing new wikis. This does not affect existing wikis.
* User auto-creations are now performed as the target user instead of
  anonymous IP user.
* Corrected the interpretation of empty arrays in extension configuration when
  the default value is null. Previously, an empty array specified by the
  administrator would transform into the default null value. It now
  appropriately retains its empty array state.
* (T362536) Exempted "deletedhistory", "deletedtext", and "viewsuppressed"
  rights from namespace protection ($wgNamespaceProtection) since that's
  only meant to prevent write actions.
* …

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.43 requires PHP 8.1.0 or later and the following PHP extensions:

* ctype
* dom
* fileinfo
* iconv
* intl
* json
* mbstring
* openssl
* xml

MariaDB is the recommended database software. MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite can

== Online documentation ==
Documentation for both end-users and site administrators is available on
MediaWiki.org, and is covered under the GNU Free Documentation License (except
for pages that explicitly state that their contents are in the public domain):

  <https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Documentation>

== Mailing list ==
A mailing list is available for MediaWiki user support and discussion:

  <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-l.lists.wikimedia.org/>

A low-traffic announcements-only list is also available:

  <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/>

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.

== IRC help ==
There's usually someone online in #mediawiki on irc.libera.chat.
