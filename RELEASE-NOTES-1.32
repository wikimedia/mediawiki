== MediaWiki 1.32.0 ==

=== Changes since MediaWiki 1.32.0-rc.2 ===
* (T188327) Fix slow queries in migrateActors.php.
* (T102320) Fix $magicWords for the Sanskrit language.

=== Changes since MediaWiki 1.32.0-rc.1 ===

* Updated wikimedia/ip-set from v1.2.0 to v1.3.0.
* (T212356) When using action=delete on pages with many revisions, the module
  may return a boolean-true 'scheduled' and no 'logid'. This signifies that the
  deletion will be processed via the job queue.
* (T64103) Dropped columns category.cat_hidden, site_stats.ss_admins, and
  recentchanges.rc_cur_time from the PostgreSQL schema.

=== Changes since MediaWiki 1.32.0-rc.0 ===
* (T209885) Prevent populateSearchIndex.php from breaking once actor migration
  has been started.
* (T210998) Properly set $wgLanguageCode in the generated LocalSettings.php
  if --lang is used with the command-line installer (install.php).

=== Configuration changes in 1.32 ===

==== New configuration ====
* $wgJpegQuality – The quality of JPEG thumbnails is now configurable through
  this setting. The default is 80, which matches the quality of JPEG thumbnails
  previously generated by ImageMagick. The quality of JPEG thumbnails generated
  by GD was previously 95, but now uses the $wgJpegQuality setting as well.
* $wgCookieSetOnIpBlock - This determines whether to set a cookie when an IP
  user is blocked. Doing so means that a blocked user, even after moving to a
  new IP address, will still be blocked.
* $wgRawHtmlMessages – This new configuration setting is added for listing
  messages which are displayed as raw HTML.
* $wgCSPHeader and $wgCSPReportOnlyHeader – You can now define a
  "Content Security Policy" for your wiki. This adds a defense-in-depth feature
  to stop an attacker who has found a bug in the parser allowing them to insert
  malicious attributes. Disabled by default. (T135963)
* $wgGroupPermissions – A new user group, 'interface-admin', is added for
  controlling access to sitewide CSS/JS (and editing other users' CSS/JS). No
  other group has 'editsitecss', 'editusercss', 'editsitejs' or 'edituserjs'
  by default.
* $wgGrantPermissions – A new grant group, 'editsiteconfig', is added for
  granting the above rights.
* $wgDBDefaultGroup – A default database group for use by maintenance scripts.
* $wgResourceLoaderEnableJSProfiler – This new configuration setting lets you
  enable client-side profiling of JavaScript modules; it is off by default.
* (T193868) $wgChangeTagsSchemaMigrationStage — This temporary configuration
  setting allows sysadmins to gradually migrate the database table schema for
  how change tags are stored.
* (T199334) $wgTagStatisticsNewTable — This temporary configuration setting
  allows sysadmins to enable the caching of Special:Tags via the new
  change_tag_def table.

==== Changed configuration ====
* $wgUseAjax – This setting, deprecated in 1.31, is now ignored.
* $wgDefaultUserOptions – The default watchlist view time (watchlistdays) has
  been increased from 3 to 7 days. (T194414)
* $wgGroupPermissions – The right to edit sitewide Javascript
  (e.g. MediaWiki:Common.js), CSS or JSON was separated from 'editinterface'
  and is available under 'editsitejs'/'editsitecss'/'editsitejson'. Having
  'editinterface' is still necessary to edit such pages.
* $wgMultiContentRevisionSchemaMigrationStage now defaults to writing both the
  old and the new schema, but reading the new schema, so Multi-Content Revisions
  (MCR) are now functional per default. The new default value of the setting is
  SCHEMA_COMPAT_WRITE_BOTH | SCHEMA_COMPAT_READ_NEW.
* $wgActorTableSchemaMigrationStage no longer accepts MIGRATION_WRITE_BOTH or
  MIGRATION_WRITE_NEW. It instead uses SCHEMA_COMPAT_WRITE_BOTH |
  SCHEMA_COMPAT_READ_OLD and SCHEMA_COMPAT_WRITE_BOTH | SCHEMA_COMPAT_READ_NEW
  for intermediate stages of migration.
* $wgDBTableOptions – The default table options now use the binary charset. The
  default was already overridden in the installer-generated LocalSettings.php,
  and so is always set to binary after the installer UI option was removed. The
  default value is only used when the installer installs an extension.
* $wgPopularPasswordFile — The location of the default popular passwords file
  has been moved to be in line with other non-PHP files used by libraries and
  classes.
* $wgEnableImageWhitelist is now disabled by default, as it opens up a hole for
  potential privacy leaks by administrators. You can check
  "MediaWiki:External image whitelist" on your wiki to see whether the feature
  was ever used, and whether it needs to be re-enabled.

==== Removed configuration ====
* $wgEnableAPI and $wgEnableWriteAPI – These settings, deprecated in 1.31,
  have been removed. (T115414)
* $wgSiteSupportPage – This setting, unused since 1.5, was removed.
* $wgBrowserBlacklist – This setting, deprecated in 1.30, was removed.
* $wgExperimentalHtmlIds – This setting, deprecated since 1.30, was removed.
  The 'html5-legacy' value for $wgFragmentMode is no longer accepted.
* $wgPasswordSenderName - This setting, ignored since 1.23 by MediaWiki and
  most extensions, is no longer set. Instead, you can modify the system
  message `emailsender`.
* $wgTidyConfig – The experimental Html5Internal and Html5Depurate tidy drivers
  were removed. RemexHtml, which is the default, should be used instead.
* (T181318) The $wgStyleVersion setting and its appendage to various script and
  style URLs in OutputPage, deprecated in 1.31, was removed.
* (T140807) The wgResourceLoaderLESSImportPaths configuration option was removed
  from ResourceLoader. Instead, use `@import` statements in LESS to import
  files directly from nearby directories within the same project.
* (T140804) The wgResourceLoaderLESSVars configuration option, deprecated
  since 1.30, was removed. Instead, to expose variables from PHP to LESS, use
  the ResourceLoaderModule::getLessVars() method.
* $wgResourceLoaderValidateStaticJS – This setting, unused since MediaWiki 1.18,
  was removed.
* Two temporary variables for deploying the feature of filters on change lists,
  $wgStructuredChangeFiltersShowPreference introduced in MediaWiki 1.30 and
  $wgStructuredChangeFiltersOnWatchlist in 1.31, were removed.

=== New features in 1.32 ===
* (T112474) Generalized the ResourceLoader mechanism for overriding modules
  using a particular page during edit previews.
* (T12331) You can now log page creation events by setting $wgPageCreationLog
  to true.
* Added 'ApiParseMakeOutputPage' hook.
* (T174313) Added checkbox on Special:ListUsers to display only users in
  temporary user groups.
* (T152462) A cookie can now be set when an IP user is blocked to track that
  user if they move to a new IP address. This is disabled by default.
* (T194950) Added 'ApiMaxLagInfo' hook.
* SpecialPage::checkLoginSecurityLevel() will now preserve POST data when
  reauthenticating.
* FormSpecialPage::execute() will now call checkLoginSecurityLevel() if
  getLoginSecurityLevel() returns non-false.
* The 'ImageBeforeProduceHTML' hook is now passed three new parameters, $parser,
  &$query and &$widthOption, allowing extensions even finer control over the
  resulting HTML code.
* Added new 'ArticleShowPatrolFooter' hook, which allows extensions to determine
  if the [mark as patrolled] link should be shown at the footer of patrollable
  pages.
* The array of hidden options ($opts) passed to the 'SpecialSearchPowerBox' hook
  is now passed by reference, allowing extensions to modify or even unset it.
* Added new 'OutputPageAfterGetHeadLinksArray' hook, allowing extensions to
  modify the return value of OutputPage#getHeadLinksArray in order to add,
  remove or otherwise alter the elements to be output in the page <head>.
* (T28934) The 'HistoryPageToolLinks' hook allows extensions to append
  additional links to the subtitle of a history page.
* The 'GetLinkColours' hook now receives an additional $title parameter,
  the Title object of the page being parsed, on which the links will be shown.
* (T194731) DifferenceEngine supports multiple slots. Added SlotDiffRenderer to
  render diffs between two Content objects, and DifferenceEngine::setRevisions()
  to render diffs between two custom (potentially multi-content) revisions.
  Added GetSlotDiffRenderer hook which works like GetDifferenceEngine for slots.
* Added a temporary action=mcrundo to the web UI, as the normal undo logic
  can't yet handle MCR and deadlines are forcing is to put off fixing that.
  This action should be considered deprecated and should not be used directly.
* Extensions overriding ContentHandler::getUndoContent() will need to be
  updated for the changed method signature.
* Added a new hook, 'UserGetRightsRemove', which can be used to remove rights
  from user. Unlike the 'UserGetRights' it will ensure that removed rights
  will not be reinserted.
* (T197535) Extensions can now specify PHP versions and PHP extensions they
  depend on.

=== External library changes in 1.32 ===

=== Bug fixes in 1.32 ===
* SpecialPage::execute() will now only call checkLoginSecurityLevel() if
  getLoginSecurityLevel() returns non-false.
* (T43720, T46197) Improved page display title handling for category pages.
* (T65080) Fixed resetting options of some types via API action=options.
* (T198054) Fixed login crash caused by invalid/unknown language code for
  the 'uselang' parameter.

=== Action API changes in 1.32 ===
* Added templated parameters.
  * A module can define a templated parameter like "{fruit}-quantity", where
    the actual parameters recognized correspond to the values of a multi-valued
    parameter. Then clients can make requests like
    "fruits=apples|bananas&apples-quantity=1&bananas-quantity=5".
  * action=paraminfo will return templated parameter definitions separately
    from normal parameters. All parameter definitions now include an "index"
    key to allow clients to maintain parameter ordering when merging normal and
    templated parameters.
* It is now an error to submit too many values for a multi-valued parameter.
  This has generated a warning since MediaWiki 1.14.
* Assertion failures from the 'assert' and 'assertuser' parameters will no
  longer use the action module's custom response format, for the few modules
  that use custom formatters that handle errors.
* (T198935) User list preferences such as `email-blacklist` and similar
  extension preferences are no longer represented as arrays when returned by
  action=query&meta=userinfo&uiprop=options.
* 'missingparam' errors will now use the prefixed parameter name in the code
  and error text, e.g. "noxxfoo" and "The 'xxfoo' parameter must be set" rather
  than "nofoo" and "The 'foo' parameter must be set".
* action=query&prop=revisions now takes a 'rvslots' parameter to indicate the
  multi-content revision slots for which content should be returned. It also
  has a new rvprop, 'roles', to indicate which roles have slots. A deprecation
  warning will be issued if rvprop=content or rvprop=contentmodel are used
  without rvslots.
* The rvcontentformat parameter to action=query&prop=revisions has been
  deprecated. Clients should be prepared to deal with the default format for
  relevant models.
* Use of the deprecated parameters rvexpandtemplates, rvgeneratexml, rvparse,
  rvdiffto, rvdifftotext, rvdifftotextpst, rvcontentformat, or the deprecated
  rvprop=parsetree is forbidden with the new 'rvslots' parameter.
* action=query&prop=deletedrevisions, action=query&list=allrevisions, and
  action=query&list=alldeletedrevisions are changed similarly to
  &prop=revisions (see the three previous items).
* (T174032) action=compare now supports multi-content revisions.
  * It has a 'slots' parameter to select diffing of individual slots. The
    default behavior is to return one combined diff.
  * The 'fromtext', 'fromsection', 'fromcontentmodel', 'fromcontentformat',
    'totext', 'tosection', 'tocontentmodel', and 'tocontentformat' parameters
    are deprecated. Specify the new 'fromslots' and 'toslots' to identify which
    slots have text supplied and the corresponding templated parameters for
    each slot.
  * The behavior of 'fromsection' and 'tosection' of extracting one section's
    content is not being preserved. 'fromsection-{slot}' and 'tosection-{slot}'
    instead expand the given text as if for a section edit. This effectively
    declines T183823 in favor of T185723.
* (T198214) The 'disabletidy' parameter to action=parse has been
  deprecated; untidy output will not be supported by future wikitext
  parsers.
* Added intestactionsdetail to action=query&prop=info to allow retrieving the
  reasons an action is not allowed.
* Deprecated action=query&prop=info inprop=readable in favor of
  intestactions=read.
* (T212356) When using action=delete on pages with many revisions, the module
  may return a boolean-true 'scheduled' and no 'logid'. This signifies that the
  deletion will be processed via the job queue.

=== Action API internal changes in 1.32 ===
* Added 'ApiParseMakeOutputPage' hook.
* Parameter names may no longer contain '{' or '}', as these are now used for
  templated parameters.
* (T194950) Added 'ApiMaxLagInfo' hook.
* The following methods now take a RevisionRecord rather than a Revision. No
  external callers are known.
  * ApiFeedContributions::feedItemAuthor()
  * ApiFeedContributions::feedItemDesc()
  * ApiQueryRevisionsBase::extractRevisionInfo()
* The following deprecated methods have been removed:
  * ApiBase::profileIn() (deprecated in 1.25)
  * ApiBase::profileOut() (deprecated in 1.25)
  * ApiBase::safeProfileOut() (deprecated in 1.25)
  * ApiBase::profileDBIn() (deprecated in 1.25)
  * ApiBase::profileDBOut() (deprecated in 1.25)
  * ApiBase::dieUsage() (deprecated in 1.29)
  * ApiBase::dieUsageMsg() (deprecated in 1.29)
  * ApiBase::dieUsageMsgOrDebug() (deprecated in 1.29)
  * ApiBase::getErrorFromStatus() (deprecated in 1.29)
  * ApiBase::parseMsg() (deprecated in 1.29)
  * ApiBase::setWarning() (deprecated in 1.29)
  * ApiPageSet::getInvalidTitles() (deprecated in 1.26)
  * ApiQueryLogEvents::addLogParams() (deprecated in 1.25)
  * ApiUsageException::getCodeString() (deprecated in 1.29)
  * ApiUsageException::getMessageArray() (deprecated in 1.29)
* Class UsageException, deprecated in 1.29, has been removed.
* ApiErrorFormatter: Added getFormat() and newWithFormat(). In particular, you
  can now easily test $formatter->getFormat() === 'bc', and then call
  $formatter->newWithFormat( 'plaintext' ) to get a non-BC formatter.

=== Languages updated in 1.32 ===
MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated regularly.
Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as changes to languages
because of Phabricator reports.

  MediaWiki\Session\Token::SUFFIX instead.
* EditPage::isOouiEnabled() deprecated in 1.30, was removed.

  were deprecated in 1.25, have now been removed:
  * Revision::getRawUser()
  * Revision::getRawUserText()
  * Revision::getRawComment()
* window.gM() from mediawiki.jqueryMsg, deprecated in 1.23, was removed. Use
  mw.msg() or mw.message() instead.
* mw.util.escapeId(), deprecated in 1.30, was removed. Use
  mw.util.escapeIdForAttribute or mw.util.escapeIdForLink instead.
* mw.util.updateTooltipAccessKeys(), deprecated in 1.24, was removed. Use
  jquery.accessKeyLabel instead.
* The SqlDataUpdate class, deprecated in 1.28, has been removed.
* The Html5Internal and Html5Depurate tidy driver classes were removed, along
  with the Balancer tidy implementation. Both implementations were experimental,
  and were replaced by RemexHtml.
* (T179624) Job::insert() and ::batchInsert(), deprecated in 1.21, were both
  removed. Use JobQueueGroup::singleton()->push() instead.

  removed. Use mediawiki.widgets.visibleLengthLimit instead.
* The jquery.farbtastic module, unused since 1.18, was removed.
* The 'jquery.expandableField' module, unused since 1.22, was removed.
* The hooks 'PreferencesFormPreSave' and 'PreferencesGetLegend' may provide
  any HTMLForm object rather than PreferencesForm.
* The non namespaced TimestampException class, deprecated in 1.29, was removed.
  Use Wikimedia\Timestamp\TimestampException instead.
* The global functions codepointToUtf8, hexSequenceToUtf8, utf8ToHexSequence,
  utf8ToCodepoint, and escapeSingleString (deprecated in 1.25) were removed.
  The UtfNormal\Utils class from the utfnormal library should be used instead.
* The deprecated UTF8_ and UNICODE_ constants were removed. The class constants
  from the UtfNormal\Constants class from the utfnormal library should be used
* The protected methods PHPSessionHandler::returnSuccess() and returnFailure(),
  only needed for PHP5 compatibility, have been removed. It now uses the boolean
  values `true` and `false` respectively.
* The $parserMemc global and wfGetParserCacheStorage(), deprecated since 1.30,
  were removed. Use the ParserCache class instead.

  deprecated since 1.26, was removed. Use getDefinitionSummary() instead.
* (T195256) Skins are recommended not to rely on JavaScript for the "mw-jump"
  and "jump-to-nav" accessibility links. To this end, the "jquery.mw-jump"
  is no longer loaded by default. The Vector and MonoBook skins have made a
  minor change to implement the toggle feature with CSS instead. To restore
  prior functionality, either explicitly load "jquery.mw-jump" in your skin
  or refer to T195256 for details on how to make the same change.
* Hook 'EditPageBeforeEditChecks' was removed;
  use 'EditPageGetCheckboxesDefinition' instead.
* Linker::getLinkColour() and DummyLinker::getLinkColour(), deprecated since
  1.28, were removed. LinkRenderer::getLinkClasses() should be used instead.
* Wikimedia\Rdbms\LoadBalancer::getLaggedSlaveMode(), deprecated in 1.28, has
  been removed. Use Wikimedia\Rdbms\LoadBalancer::getLaggedReplicaMode()
  instead.
* mw.widgets.CategoryMultiselectWidget now uses TagMultiselectWidget instead of
  CapsuleMultiselectWidget. The following methods may no longer be used:
  * setItemsFromData: Use setValue instead
  * getItemsData: Use getItems instead and get the data property
* Two OutputPage methods, addMetadataLink() and getMetadataAttribute(), were
  removed.  Use addLink() instead.
* Another two OutputPage methods, setPageTitleActionText() and
  getPageTitleActionText(), were removed.  They did nothing since 1.15 (almost
  ten years).  Use setHTMLTitle() directly.
* The return value of OutputPage::adaptCdnTTL() has been removed. The
  value returned was misleading and probably not what any caller would
  have wanted.
* All MagicWord static member variables have been removed.  Use appropriate
  hooks or MagicWordFactory methods instead.
* MagicWord::clearCache() has been removed.  Instead, create a new
  MagicWordFactory, such as by calling
  resetServiceForTesting( 'MagicWordFactory' ) on a MediaWikiServices.
* mw.util.init() has been removed. This function is not needed anymore and was
  a no-op function since 1.30.
* SpecialPageFactory::resetList() is a no-op.  Call overrideMwServices()
  instead.
* MediaWiki no longer supports a StartProfiler.php file. Instead, you can set
  $wgProfiler and $wgEnableProfileInfo.
* The mw.loader.addSource() is now considered a private method, and no longer
  supports the `id, url` signature. Use the `Object` parameter instead.
* The backwards-compatibility code in HTMLForm to add a drop-down control to an
  option that is not set to be a drop-down if the "mw-chosen" class is present,
  is now removed.
* Several collations were removed. They were workarounds for bugs in the ICU
  library and they are no longer needed (as of ICU 57.1):
  * 'uppercase-se' (NorthernSamiUppercaseCollation) - use 'uca-se' instead
  * 'xx-uca-et' (CollationEt) - use 'uca-et' instead
  * 'xx-uca-fa' (CollationFa) - use 'uca-fa' instead
* LanguageCode::bcp47() now always returns a valid BCP 47 code.  This means
  that some MediaWiki-specific language codes, such as `simple`, are mapped
  into valid BCP 47 codes (eg `en-simple`).
* The hooks 'SpecialRecentChangesFilters' & 'SpecialWatchlistFilters' deprecated
  in 1.23 were removed. Instead, use 'ChangesListSpecialPageStructuredFilters'.
  The ChangesListSpecialPage code for these legacy hooks, and their use in
  SpecialRecentchanges.php and SpecialWatchlist, was also removed:
  * ChangesListSpecialPage->getCustomFilters()
  * ChangesListSpecialPage->getFilterGroupDefinitionFromLegacyCustomFilters()
  * ChangesListSpecialPage::customFilters
* The global function wfUseMW, deprecated since 1.26, has now been removed. Use
  the "requires" property of static extension registration instead.
* $wgSpecialPages no longer accepts array syntax, deprecated since 1.18.
* The MailAddress constructor can no longer be called with a User object,
  behaviour which has been deprecated since 1.24.
* LBFactory, deprecated since 1.28, has been removed. Instead, use
  Wikimedia\Rdbms\LBFactory.
* The MimeMagic class, deprecated since 1.28 has been removed. Get a
  MimeAnalyzer instance from MediaWikiServices instead.
* The '--tidy' option to maintenance/parse.php has been removed.  Tidying
  the output is now the default.  Use '--no-tidy' to bypass the tidy
  phase.
* The global function wfErrorLog, deprecated since 1.25, has now been removed.
  Use MWLoggerLegacyLogger::emit or UDPTransport.
* The hooks 'SpecialRecentChangesQuery' & 'SpecialWatchlistQuery', deprecated in
  1.23, were removed. Instead, use ChangesListSpecialPageStructuredFilters or
  ChangesListSpecialPageQuery.
* The global function wfUsePHP, deprecated since 1.30, has now been removed. To
  assert a newer version of PHP than MediaWiki does, use extension registration.
* The hook 'ChangesListSpecialPageFilters', deprecated in 1.29, has now been
  removed. Use the 'ChangesListSpecialPageStructuredFilters' hook instead.
* DeferredUpdates::setImmediateMode(), deprecated since 1.29, has been removed.
* File / MediaHandler::getStreamHeaders(), deprecated since 1.30, was removed.
* The hook 'DoEditSectionLink', deprecated since 1.25, has been removed. Use
  the hook 'SkinEditSectionLinks' instead.
* The hook 'UserGetImplicitGroups', deprecated since 1.25, has been removed.
* The global function wfRunHooks, deprecated since 1.25, has now been removed.
  Use Hooks::run().
* The hook 'UnknownAction', deprecated since 1.19, has now been removed.
* The hook 'ParserLimitReport', deprecated since 1.22, has been removed. Use
  the hooks 'ParserLimitReportPrepare' and 'ParserLimitReportFormat' instead.
* The following deprecated API methods have been removed:
  * ApiBase::profileIn() (deprecated in 1.25)
  * ApiBase::profileOut() (deprecated in 1.25)
  * ApiBase::safeProfileOut() (deprecated in 1.25)
  * ApiBase::profileDBIn() (deprecated in 1.25)
  * ApiBase::profileDBOut() (deprecated in 1.25)
  * ApiBase::dieUsage() (deprecated in 1.29)
  * ApiBase::dieUsageMsg() (deprecated in 1.29)
  * ApiBase::dieUsageMsgOrDebug() (deprecated in 1.29)
  * ApiBase::getErrorFromStatus() (deprecated in 1.29)
  * ApiBase::parseMsg() (deprecated in 1.29)
  * ApiBase::setWarning() (deprecated in 1.29)
  * ApiPageSet::getInvalidTitles() (deprecated in 1.26)
  * ApiQueryLogEvents::addLogParams() (deprecated in 1.25)
  * ApiUsageException::getCodeString() (deprecated in 1.29)
  * ApiUsageException::getMessageArray() (deprecated in 1.29)
* Class UsageException, deprecated in 1.29, has been removed.
* MediaWiki no longer has a 'JavaScript-powered' wikitext toolbar built in. The
  old "bulletin board style toolbar", known as "the 2006 wikitext editor", has
  been removed, and instead sysadmins will be required to choose one (or more)
  of the several extensions available for this purpose if they need the
  functionality. The MediaWiki "tarball" releases have included the replacement
  extension for this, the WikiEditor extension aka "the 2010 wikitext editor",
  for many years now. As part of this, several parts of MediaWiki have been
  removed or simplified:
  * The user option 'showtoolbar' (shown as "Show edit toolbar") is no longer
    available; if an extension adds a toolbar via the EditPageBeforeEditToolbar
    hook, it will be shown; extensions should provide a specific user preference
    to disable themselves as needed.
  * The public methods Language::getImageFile() and ::getImageFiles(), and the
    related specification of $imageFiles within individual languages' code file,
    as well as the referenced static media assets, all of which were only used
    inside MediaWiki itself for providing the icons for the old toolbar, have
    been removed without explicit deprecation.
  * The internal ResourceLoader module "mediawiki.toolbar", which is unused
    except by MediaWiki itself and back-compatibility code, has been removed.
  * The internal ResourceLoaderEditToolbarModule class has been removed.

=== Deprecations in 1.32 ===
* HTMLForm::setSubmitProgressive() is deprecated. No need to call it. Submit
  button is already marked as progressive.
* Skin::setupSkinUserCss() is deprecated. Adding of modules to load
  has been centralised to Skin::getDefaultModules(), which is now capable
  of queueing style modules as well.
* OutputPage::addModuleScripts() and ParserOutput::addModuleScripts are
  deprecated. Use addModules() instead.
* Overriding SearchEngine::{searchText,searchTitle,searchArchiveTitle}
  in extending classes is deprecated.  Extend related doSearch* methods
  instead.
* The following 'mediawiki.api' plugin modules were merged into mediawiki.api
  and deprecated: mediawiki.api.category, mediawiki.api.edit,
  mediawiki.api.login, mediawiki.api.options, mediawiki.api.parse,
  mediawiki.api.upload, mediawiki.api.user, mediawiki.api.watch,
  mediawiki.api.messages, and mediawiki.api.rollback.
* ApiBase::truncateArray() is deprecated. No replacement, as nothing is known
  to use it.
* WatchAction::getUnwatchToken is deprecated. Use WatchAction::getWatchToken
  with the 'unwatch' action parameter instead.
* IcuCollation::getICUVersion() is deprecated, as you can just use the PHP
  constant INTL_ICU_VERSION directly in all versions that MediaWiki supports.
* Parser::fetchFile() is deprecated. Use ::fetchFileAndTitle() instead.
* The ApiQueryContributions class has been renamed to ApiQueryUserContribs.
* The XMPInfo, XMPReader, and XMPValidate classes have been deprecated in favor
  of the namespaced classes provided by the wikimedia/xmp-reader library.
* SearchResultSet::{next,rewind} are deprecated. Calling code should
  use foreach on the SearchResultSet, or the extractResults method. Extending
  code should override extractResults.
* Instantiating SearchResultSet directly is deprecated. SearchEngine
  implementations must subclass SearchResultSet for their purposes.
* SearchResult::setExtensionData argument has been changed from accepting an
  array to accepting a Closure that returns the array when called.
* Class CryptRand, everything in MWCryptRand except generateHex() and function
  MediaWikiServices::getCryptRand() are deprecated, use random_bytes() to
  generate cryptographically secure random byte sequences.
* Parser::getConverterLanguage() is deprecated.  Use ::getTargetLanguage()
  instead.
* Language::markNoConversion() is deprecated.  It confused readers because
  it had unexpected behavior (only marking text if it looked like a URL)
  and was only used in a single place in the code.  Use
  LanguageConverter::markNoConversion() instead.
* (T197492) Language::truncate() was soft deprecated in 1.31 and is
  hard deprecated in this release.  It has been split into two similar
  methods, Language::truncateForVisual() and Language::truncateForDatabase(),
  which measure length in characters and bytes, respectively.  Use
  Language::truncateForVisual() when possible to provide equity to users
  of multibyte scripts.
* (T176526) EditPage::getContextTitle() falling back to $wgTitle when the
  context title is unset is now deprecated; anything creating an EditPage
  instance should set the context title via ::setContextTitle().
* The 'jquery.hidpi' module (polyfill for IMG srcset) is deprecated.
* ResourceLoaderStartUpModule::getStartupModules() and ::getLegacyModules()
  are deprecated. These concepts are obsolete and have no replacement.
* String type for $lang of DifferenceEngine::setTextLanguage is deprecated.
* The following methods of OutputPage are now deprecated in favour
  of using showFatalError directly: OutputPage::showFileDeleteError()
  OutputPage::showFileNotFoundError(), OutputPage::showFileRenameError()
  OutputPage::showFileCopyError() and OutputPage::showUnexpectedValueError().
* The Replacer, DoubleReplacer, HashtableReplacer, and RegexlikeReplacer
  classes are now deprecated. Use a Closure instead.
* (T194263) ContentHandler::makeParserOptions() is deprecated. Use
  WikiPage::makeParserOptions() or ParserOptions::newCanonical() instead.
* (T100681) Use of the Parsoid v1 API with the VirtualRESTService, deprecated in
  MediaWiki 1.26,  is now hard-deprecated. All known clients were converted to
  the Parsoid v3 API in May 2015.
* $input is deprecated in hook 'LogEventsListGetExtraInputs'. Use
  $formDescriptor instead.
* SearchEngine::transformSearchTerm( $term ) should no longer be called prior
  to running searchText. This method was mainly implemented to support the
  'prefix' URI param in SpecialSearch, but there are no reasons to expose this
  logic as it should be handled internally by SearchEngine implementations
  supporting this feature. SearchEngine implementations should no longer
  override this methods.
* SearchEngine::replacePrefixes( $query ) should no longer be called prior
  to running searchText/searchTitle.
* (T199657) Messages for $wgFilterLogTypes labels should be no longer be in the
  'log-show-hide-[type]' format. Instead use 'logeventslist-[type]-log'.
* Global functions  wfArrayFilter() and wfArrayFilterByKey() are deprecated.
  use array_filter() directly.
* The $wgShowSQLErrors global is deprecated and nonfunctional.
  Set $wgShowExceptionDetails and/or $wgShowHostnames instead.
* The $wgShowDBErrorBacktrace global is deprecated and nonfunctional.
  Set $wgShowExceptionDetails instead.
* Public access to the DifferenceEngine properties mOldid, mNewid, mOldRev,
  mNewRev, mOldPage, mNewPage, mOldContent, mNewContent, mRevisionsLoaded,
  mTextLoaded and mCacheHit is deprecated. Use getOldid() / getNewid() /
  getOldRevision() / getNewRevision() for the first four (note that the
  revision ones return a RevisionRecord, not a Revision), do your own lookup
  for page/content.
* The $wgExternalDiffEngine value 'wikidiff2' is deprecated. To use wikidiff2
  just enable the PHP extension, and it will be autodetected.
* (T194731) DifferenceEngine properties mOldContent and mNewContent and methods
  setContent(), generateContentDiffBody(), generateTextDiffBody() and textDiff()
  are deprecated. To interact with a single slot, use a SlotDiffRenderer (and
  subclass it to customize diff rendering); to diff custom (e.g. unsaved)
  content, use setRevisions(). Subclassing DifferenceEngine should only be done
  to customize page-level diff properties (such as the navigation header).
* The wfUseMW function, soft-deprecated in 1.26, is now hard deprecated.
* All MagicWord static methods are now deprecated.  Use the MagicWordFactory
  methods instead.
* PasswordFactory::init is deprecated. To get a password factory with the
  standard configuration, use MediaWikiServices::getPasswordFactory.
* $wgContLang is deprecated, use MediaWikiServices::getContentLanguage()
  instead.
* $wgParser is deprecated, use MediaWikiServices::getParser() instead.
* wfGetMainCache() is deprecated, use ObjectCache::getLocalClusterInstance()
  instead.
* wfGetCache() is deprecated, use ObjectCache::getInstance() instead.
* All SpecialPageFactory static methods are deprecated. Instead, call the
  methods on a SpecialPageFactory instance, which may be obtained from
  MediaWikiServices.
* mw.user.stickyRandomId was renamed to the more explicit
  mw.user.getPageviewToken to better capture its function.
* Passing Revision objects to ContentHandler::getUndoContent() is deprecated,
  Content object should be passed instead.
* (T197179) Parameters 'notice', 'notice-messages', 'notice-message',
  previously used by OOUI HTMLForm fields, are now deprecated. Use
  'help', 'help-message', 'help-messages' instead.
* (T197179) HTMLFormField::getNotices() is now deprecated.
* The jquery.localize module is now deprecated. Use jquery.i18n instead.
* The SecondaryDataUpdates hook was deprecated in favor of RevisionDataUpdates,
  or overriding ContentHandler::getSecondaryDataUpdates (T194038).
* The WikiPageDeletionUpdates hook was deprecated in favor of
  PageDeletionDataUpdates, or overriding ContentHandler::getDeletionDataUpdates
  (T194038).
* Content::getSecondaryDataUpdates has been deprecated in favor of
  ContentHandler::getSecondaryDataUpdates() for overriding by extensions
  (T194038).
  Application logic should call WikiPage::doSecondaryDataUpdates() (T194037).
* Content::getDeletionUpdates has been deprecated in favor of
  ContentHandler::getDeletionUpdates() for overriding by extensions (T194038).
  Application logic should call WikiPage::doSecondaryDataUpdates() (T194037).
* (T198214) Old Tidy-related configuration settings, which were soft-deprecated
  in MediaWiki 1.26, have now been hard deprecated. This affects $wgUseTidy,
  $wgTidyBin, $wgTidyConf, $wgTidyOpts, $wgTidyInternal, and $wgDebugTidy. Use
  $wgTidyConfig instead.
* All Tidy configurations other than Remex have been hard deprecated;
  future parsers will not emit compatible output for these configurations.
  In particular, running MediaWiki with tidy disabled has been deprecated.
* (T198214) OutputPage::addWikiText(), OutputPage::addWikiTextWithTitle(),
  and OutputPage::addWikiTextTitle() have been deprecated, since they
  can result in untidy output.  In addition OutputPage::addWikiTextTidy()
  and OutputPage::addWikiTextTitleTidy() was deprecated to make naming new
  methods consistent.  Use OutputPage::addWikiTextAsInterface() or
  OutputPage::addWikiTextAsContent() instead, which ensures the output is
  tidy and clarifies whether content-language specific postprocessing should
  be done on the text.
* OutputPage::parse() and OutputPage::parseInline() have been deprecated
  due to untidy output and inconsistent handling of wrapper divs and
  interface/content language defaults.  Use OutputPage::parseAsContent(),
  OutputPage::parseAsInterface(), or OutputPage::parseInlineAsInterface()
  as appropriate.
* QuickTemplate::msgHtml() and BaseTemplate::msgHtml() have been deprecated
  as they promote bad practises. I18n messages should always be properly
  escaped.
* Skin::getDynamicStylesheetQuery() has been deprecated. It always
  returns action=raw&ctype=text/css which callers should use directly.
* Class LegacyFormatter is deprecated.
* Use of CommentStore::insertWithTempTable() with 'img_description' is
  deprecated. Use CommentStore::insert() instead.
* Language::setCode is deprecated as public function. Use Language::factory
  to create a new Language object with a different language code.
* Several classes have been moved from the MediaWiki\Storage\ namespace to the
  MediaWiki\Revision\ namespace. The old class names are aliased for
  compatibility, but are deprecated. Classes are IncompleteRevisionException,
  MutableRevisionRecord, MutableRevisionSlots, RevisionAccessException,
  RevisionArchiveRecord, RevisionFactory, RevisionLookup, RevisionRecord,
  RevisionSlots, RevisionStore, RevisionStoreRecord, SlotRecord, and
  SuppressedDataException.
* When using OOUI HTMLForm containing an 'info' field which uses the 'rawrow'
  option, it is now deprecated to give its contents (the 'default' option)
  as a string. They should be given as a OOUI\FieldLayout object instead.
  Notably, this affects fields defined in the 'GetPreferences' hook, because
  Special:Preferences uses an OOUI form now. (If possible, don't use 'rawrow'.)
* In Skin::doEditSectionLink omitting the parameters $tooltip and $lang is
  deprecated. For the $lang parameter, types other than Language are
  deprecated.
* The $wgUseKeyHeader configuration option and the
  OutputPage::getKeyHeader() method have been deprecated; the relevant
  draft IETF spec expired without becoming a standard.
* Deprecated API action=query&prop=info inprop=readable in favor of
  intestactions=read.

=== Other changes in 1.32 ===
* (T198811) The following tables have had their UNIQUE indexes turned into
  proper PRIMARY KEYs for increased maintainability: interwiki, page_props,
  protected_titles and site_identifiers.
* OOUI HTMLForm will now display help text inline after the input field,
  rather than in a popup. Previous behavior can be restored by using
  `'help-inline' => false`.
* The archive table's ar_rev_id field is now unique.
* Special:BotPasswords now requires reauthentication.
* (T174023) Multi-Content Revision (MCR) capabilities were introduced into the
  storage layer and have basic support for display. No user interface exists
  yet for creating or managing content in slots beides the main slot. See
  <https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Multi-Content_Revisions> for more
  information.
* The image_comment_temp database table has been removed. Since all access
  should be mediated by the CommentStore class, this change shouldn't affect
  external code.
* (T206147) Database::close() will no longer commit any open transactions.
* (T64103) Dropped columns category.cat_hidden, site_stats.ss_admins, and
  recentchanges.rc_cur_time from the PostgreSQL schema.

== Compatibility ==
MediaWiki 1.32 requires PHP 7.0.13 or later. Although HHVM 3.18.5 or later is
supported, it is generally advised to use PHP 7.0.13 or later for long term
support. MediaWiki requires that the mbstring, xml, ctype, json, iconv and
fileinfo PHP extensions are loaded to work.

MySQL/MariaDB is the recommended DBMS. PostgreSQL or SQLite can also be used,
but support for them is somewhat less mature. There is experimental support for
Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server.

The supported versions are:

* MySQL 5.5.8 or later
* PostgreSQL 9.2 or later
* SQLite 3.3.7 or later
* Oracle 9.0.1 or later
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 (9.00.1399)

== Upgrading ==
1.32 has several database changes since 1.31, and will not work without schema
updates. Note that due to changes to some very large tables like the revision
table, the schema update may take quite long (minutes on a medium sized site,
many hours on a large site).

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions, including
important information when upgrading from versions prior to 1.11.

For notes on 1.31.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

       https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Documentation

== Mailing list ==
A mailing list is available for MediaWiki user support and discussion:

       https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-l

A low-traffic announcements-only list is also available:

       https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-announce

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.
