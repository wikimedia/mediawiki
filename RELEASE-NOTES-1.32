== MediaWiki 1.32 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.32 is an alpha-quality branch and is not recommended for use in
production.

=== Configuration changes in 1.32 ===
* (T115414) The $wgEnableAPI and $wgEnableWriteAPI settings, deprecated in 1.31,
  have been removed.
* The $wgUseAjax setting, deprecated in 1.31, is now ignored.
* The $wgSiteSupportPage setting, unused since 1.5, was removed.
* The default quality of JPEG thumbnails generated by GD was reduced from 95 to
  80. The quality of JPEG thumbnails is now configurable through the new setting
  $wgJpegQuality (default 80). This aligns the quality to what ImageMagick uses.
* $wgExperimentalHtmlIds, deprecated since 1.30, has been removed. The
  'html5-legacy' value for $wgFragmentMode is no longer accepted.
* The experimental Html5Internal and Html5Depurate tidy drivers were removed.
  RemexHtml, which is the default, should be used instead.
* (T135963) You can now define a Content Security Policy for your wiki. This
  adds a defense-in-depth feature to stop an attacker who has found a bug in
  the parser allowing them to insert malicious attributes. Disabled by default,
  you can configure this via $wgCSPHeader and $wgCSPReportOnlyHeader.

  using a particular page during edit previews.

  Balancer tidy implementation. Both implementations were experimental, and were replaced
  by RemexHtml.

=== Deprecations in 1.32 ===
* Use of a StartProfiler.php file is deprecated in favour of placing
  configuration in LocalSettings.php.
* HTMLForm::setSubmitProgressive() is deprecated. No need to call it. Submit
  button is already marked as progressive.
* Skin::setupSkinUserCss() is deprecated. Adding of modules to load
  has been centralised to Skin::getDefaultModules(), which is now capable
  of queueing style modules as well.
* OutputPage::addModuleScripts() and ParserOutput::addModuleScripts are
  deprecated. Use addModules() instead.

== Compatibility ==
MediaWiki 1.32 requires PHP 5.5.9 or later. Although HHVM 3.18.5 or later is
supported, it is generally advised to use PHP 5.5.9 or later for long term
support.

MySQL/MariaDB is the recommended DBMS. PostgreSQL or SQLite can also be used,
but support for them is somewhat less mature. There is experimental support for
Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server.

The supported versions are:

* MySQL 5.5.8 or later
* PostgreSQL 9.2 or later
* SQLite 3.3.7 or later
* Oracle 9.0.1 or later
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 (9.00.1399)

== Upgrading ==
1.32 has several database changes since 1.31, and will not work without schema
updates. Note that due to changes to some very large tables like the revision
table, the schema update may take quite long (minutes on a medium sized site,
many hours on a large site).

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions, including
important information when upgrading from versions prior to 1.11.

For notes on 1.31.x and older releases, see HISTORY.
