== MediaWiki 1.32 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.32 is an alpha-quality branch and is not recommended for use in
production.

=== Configuration changes in 1.32 ===
* (T115414) The $wgEnableAPI and $wgEnableWriteAPI settings, deprecated in 1.31,
  have been removed.
* The $wgUseAjax setting, deprecated in 1.31, is now ignored.
* The $wgSiteSupportPage setting, unused since 1.5, was removed.
* The default quality of JPEG thumbnails generated by GD was reduced from 95 to
  80. The quality of JPEG thumbnails is now configurable through the new setting
  $wgJpegQuality (default 80). This aligns the quality to what ImageMagick uses.
* $wgExperimentalHtmlIds, deprecated since 1.30, has been removed. The
  'html5-legacy' value for $wgFragmentMode is no longer accepted.
* The experimental Html5Internal and Html5Depurate tidy drivers were removed.
  RemexHtml, which is the default, should be used instead.
* (T135963) You can now define a Content Security Policy for your wiki. This
  adds a defense-in-depth feature to stop an attacker who has found a bug in
  the parser allowing them to insert malicious attributes. Disabled by default,
  you can configure this via $wgCSPHeader and $wgCSPReportOnlyHeader.
* New configuration variable has been added: $wgCookieSetOnIpBlock.
  This determines whether to set a cookie when an IP user is blocked. Doing so means
  that a blocked user, even after moving to a new IP address, will still be blocked.
* The archive table's ar_rev_id field is now unique.

=== New features in 1.32 ===
* (T112474) Generalized the ResourceLoader mechanism for overriding modules
  using a particular page during edit previews.
* (T12331) You can now log page creation events by setting $wgPageCreationLog
  to true.
* Added 'ApiParseMakeOutputPage' hook.
* (T174313) Added checkbox on Special:ListUsers to display only users in
  temporary user groups.
* (T152462) A cookie can now be set when an IP user is blocked to track that user if
  they move to a new IP address. This is disabled by default.
* (T194950) Added 'ApiMaxLagInfo' hook.

=== External library changes in 1.32 ===
* …

==== Upgraded external libraries ====
* Updated QUnit from 2.4.0 to 2.6.0.
* Updated wikimedia/scoped-callback from 1.0.0 to 2.0.0.
** ScopedCallback objects can no longer be serialized.
* Updated wikimedia/wrappedstring from 2.3.0 to 3.0.1.

==== New external libraries ====

* …

==== Removed and replaced external libraries ====
* …

=== Bug fixes in 1.32 ===
* …

=== Action API changes in 1.32 ===
* Added templated parameters.
  * A module can define a templated parameter like "{fruit}-quantity", where
    the actual parameters recognized correspond to the values of a multi-valued
    parameter. Then clients can make requests like
    "fruits=apples|bananas&apples-quantity=1&bananas-quantity=5".
  * action=paraminfo will return templated parameter definitions separately
    from normal parameters. All parameter definitions now include an "index"
    key to allow clients to maintain parameter ordering when merging normal and
    templated parameters.
* It is now an error to submit too many values for a multi-valued parameter.
  This has generated a warning since MediaWiki 1.14.

=== Action API internal changes in 1.32 ===
* Added 'ApiParseMakeOutputPage' hook.
* Parameter names may no longer contain '{' or '}', as these are now used for
  templated parameters.
* (T194950) Added 'ApiMaxLagInfo' hook.

=== Languages updated in 1.32 ===
MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated regularly.
Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as changes to languages
because of Phabricator reports.

* (T193566) Added language support for Ambonese Malay (abs).
* (T194047) Added language support for Shawiya, Latin script (shy-latn).
* (T195940) Added language support for Batak Mandailing (btm).

=== Other changes in 1.32 ===
* …

== Compatibility ==
MediaWiki 1.32 requires PHP 7.0.0 or later. Although HHVM 3.18.5 or later is
supported, it is generally advised to use PHP 7.0.0 or later for long term
support.

MySQL/MariaDB is the recommended DBMS. PostgreSQL or SQLite can also be used,
but support for them is somewhat less mature. There is experimental support for
Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server.

The supported versions are:

* MySQL 5.5.8 or later
* PostgreSQL 9.2 or later
* SQLite 3.3.7 or later
* Oracle 9.0.1 or later
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 (9.00.1399)

== Upgrading ==
1.32 has several database changes since 1.31, and will not work without schema
updates. Note that due to changes to some very large tables like the revision
table, the schema update may take quite long (minutes on a medium sized site,
many hours on a large site).

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions, including
important information when upgrading from versions prior to 1.11.

For notes on 1.31.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

       https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-announce

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.
