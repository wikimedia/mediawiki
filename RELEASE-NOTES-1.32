== Compatibility ==
MediaWiki 1.32 requires PHP 5.5.9 or later. Although HHVM 3.18.5 or later is supported,
it is generally advised to use PHP 5.5.9 or later for long term support.

MySQL/MariaDB is the recommended DBMS. PostgreSQL or SQLite can also be used,
but support for them is somewhat less mature. There is experimental support for
Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server.

The supported versions are:

* MySQL 5.5.8 or later
* PostgreSQL 9.2 or later
* SQLite 3.3.7 or later
* Oracle 9.0.1 or later
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 (9.00.1399)

== Upgrading ==
1.32 has several database changes since 1.31, and will not work without schema
updates. Note that due to changes to some very large tables like the revision
table, the schema update may take quite long (minutes on a medium sized site,
many hours on a large site).

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions, including
important information when upgrading from versions prior to 1.11.

For notes on 1.31.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.
