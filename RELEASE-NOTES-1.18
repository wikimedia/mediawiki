= MediaWiki release notes =

Security reminder: MediaWiki does not require PHP's register_globals
setting since version 1.2.0. If you have it on, turn it '''off''' if you can.

== MediaWiki 1.18 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.18 is an alpha-quality branch and is not recommended for use in
production.

=== Configuration changes in 1.18 ===
* The WantedPages::getSQL hook has been removed and replaced with
  WantedPages::getQueryInfo. This may break older extensions.
* The SkinTemplateBuildContentActionUrlsAfterSpecialPage,
  SkinTemplateContentActions and SkinTemplateTabs hooks have been removed in
  favor of SkinTemplateNavigation and SkinTemplateNavigation::SpecialPage
* $wgUseCombinedLoginLink controls whether to output a combined
  login / create account link in the personal bar, or to output separate login
  and create account links.
* Skin names are no longer created based on a ucfirst version of the key in
  $wgValidSkinNames but now the value. This means for
  $wgValidSkinNames["monobook"] = "MonoBook"; the skin loader will no longer try
  loading SkinMonobook and will instead load SkinMonoBook.
* $wgMaxUploadSize may now be set to an array to specify the upload size limit
  per upload type.
* $wgAPICacheHelp added in 1.16 is now removed. To disable API help caching, set
  $wgAPICacheHelpTimeout = 0;
* OutputPage::isUserJsAllowed() no longer returns false when scripts are allowed
  by the page, but $wgAllowUserJs is set to false.
* Pure "Skin" class based custom skins are no longer supported, all custom skins
  should be put together using SkinTemplate and BaseTemplate or QuickTemplate.
* The transliteration for passwords in case they were migrated from an old
  Latin-1 install (previous to MediaWiki 1.5) is now only done for wikis with
  $wgLegacyEncoding set.
* (bug 27508) Add $wgSVGMetadataCutoff to limit the maximum amount of an SVG we
  look at when finding metadata to prevent excessive resource usage.
* $wgSysopUserBans and $wgSysopRangeBans (deprecated in 1.17) are now removed.
  Use $wgBlockCIDRLimit = array( 'IPv4' => 43, 'IPv6' => 128 ) to achieve the
  same functionality as $wgSysopRangeBans; you can use the BlockIp hook to
  replicate $wgSysopUserBans functionality.
* The options on the block form have been standardised such that checking a box
  makes the block 'more serious'; so while "check to prevent account creation"
  and "check to enable autoblock" remain the same, "check to allow user-talk
  edit" is reversed to "check to *disable* user-talk edit", and "check to block
  anon-only" becomes "check to block logged-in users too".  The default settings
  remain the same.
* Most of the field names on the Special:Block form have been changed, which
  will probably break screen-scraping bots.
* (bug 26866) The 'trackback' right is no longer granted to sysops by default.
  $wgUseTrackbacks is already false by default.
* (bug 17009) the hiddenStructure CSS class, a highly hackish way of at least
  *appearing* to hide article elements, has been removed.  Use the
  ParserFunctions extension to actually remove unwanted elements from the
  output.
* (bug 14202) $wgUseTeX has been superseded by the Math extension. To re-enable
  math conversion after upgrading, obtain the Math extension from SVN or from
  http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Math and add to LocalSettings.php:
  require_once "$IP/extensions/Math/Math.php";
* $wgProfiler is now a configuration array, see StartProfiler.sample for
  details.
* $wgProfiling has been removed.
* The spyc library is now no longer included in phase3.
* (bug 28343) Unused preferences contextlines/contextchars have been removed
* $wgSkinExtensionFunctions has been removed. Use $wgExtensionFunctions instead.
* $wgProto has been removed. You now only need to set $wgServer to change the
  URL protocol.
* $wgRateLimitsExcludedGroups (deprecated in 1.13) has been removed
* $wgInputEncoding and $wgOutputEncoding (deprecated in 1.5) have now been removed
* $wgAllowUserSkin (deprecated in 1.16) has now been removed
* $wgExtraRandompageSQL (deprecated in 1.16) has now been removed
* LogReader and LogViewer classes (deprecated in 1.14) have now been removed
* (bug 26033) Added $wgArticleCountMethod to select the method to use to say
  whether a page is an article or not. $wgUseCommaCount is now deprecated.
* $wgEnableDublinCoreRdf and $wgEnableCreativeCommonsRdf no longer work in core,
  and the functionality has been moved to the relevant extensions. See
  http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:DublinCoreRdf and
  http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:CreativeCoreRdf as appropriate
* (bug 21107) Split error "customcssjsprotected" into separate messages for JS and CSS
* Removed $wgCheckCopyrightUpload from DefaultSettings, since the relevant feature
  was removed in about 1.5.
* LogPageValidTypes, LogPageLogName, LogPageLogHeader and LogPageActionText
  hooks have been removed.
* New hook "Collation::factory" to allow extensions to create custom
  category collations.

  skin customizability of edit section links.
* (bug 24755) AuthPlugin auto-creation of local accounts can now be aborted by
  other extensions by handling the 'AbortAutoAccount' hook, similar to the
  'AbortNewAccount' triggered by explicit account creations. (They are separate

  AbortNewAccount separately.

* (bug 28556) Upload support for MacBinary files has been removed (Used by

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.18 requires PHP 5.2.3. PHP 4 is no longer supported.

MySQL is the recommended DBMS. PostgreSQL, Oracle or SQLite can also be used, but
support for them is somewhat less mature. There is experimental support for IBM
DB2 and Microsoft SQL Server.

The supported versions are:

* MySQL 4.0 or later
* PostgreSQL 8.3 or later
* SQLite 3
* Oracle 9.0.1 or later

== Upgrading ==

1.18 has several database changes since 1.17, and will not work without schema
updates.

If upgrading from before 1.11, and you are using a wiki as a commons
repository, make sure that it is updated as well. Otherwise, errors may arise
due to database schema changes.

If upgrading from before 1.7, you may want to run refreshLinks.php to ensure
new database fields are filled with data.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, some major database
changes are made, and there is a slightly higher chance that things could
break. Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.

For notes on 1.15.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

== Online documentation ==

Documentation for both end-users and site administrators is available on
MediaWiki.org, and is covered under the GNU Free Documentation License (except
for pages that explicitly state that their contents are in the public domain):

	http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Documentation

== Mailing list ==

A mailing list is available for MediaWiki user support and discussion:

	http://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-l

A low-traffic announcements-only list is also available:

	http://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-announce

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.

== IRC help ==

There's usually someone online in #mediawiki on irc.freenode.net.
