== MediaWiki 1.31 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.31 is an alpha-quality branch and is not recommended for use in
production.

=== Configuration changes in 1.31 ===
* $wgEnableAPI and $wgEnableWriteAPI are now deprecated and will be removed in
  a future version. The API is now considered to be stable, secure and
  essential.
* $wgUsejQueryThree was removed, as it is now the default. This was documented as a
  temporary variable during the migration period, deprecated since 1.29.
* $wgLogoHD has been updated to support svg images and uses $wgLogo where
  possible for fallback images such as png.
* (T44246) $wgFilterLogTypes will no longer ignore 'patrol' when user does
  not have the right to mark things patrolled.
* Wikis that contain imported revisions or CentralAuth global blocks should run
  maintenance/cleanupUsersWithNoId.php.
* $wgResourceLoaderMinifierStatementsOnOwnLine and $wgResourceLoaderMinifierMaxLineLength
  were removed (deprecated since 1.27).
* (T180921) $wgReferrerPolicy now supports having fallbacks for browsers that are not
  using the latest version of the Referrer Policy specification.
* $wgFragmentMode is now set to [ 'legacy', 'html5' ] by default. This is a first step of
  migration to human-readable section IDs that will later result in 'html5' being the
  default mode.
* CACHE_ACCEL now only supports APC(u) or WinCache. XCache support was removed
  as upstream is inactive and has no plans to move to PHP 7.
* The old CategorizedRecentChanges feature, including its related configuration
  option $wgAllowCategorizedRecentChanges, has been removed.
* (T188472) The 'comma' value for $wgArticleCountMethod is no longer supported for
  performance reasons, and installations with this setting will now work as if it
  was configured with 'any'.
* (T185753) MediaWiki now defaults to using RemexHtml to tidy up user input, rather than
  being off by default. If you wish to disable HTML tidying entirely, set $wgTidyConfig
  to null; if you wish to use the old, deprecated Tidy external binary, both
  set $wgTidyConfig to null and also set $wgUseTidy to true.
* $wgLogAutopatrol now defaults to false instead of true.
* $wgValidateAllHtml was removed and will be ignored.
* $wgScriptExtension was removed (deprecated and ignored since 1.25).
  See 1.25 release notes for more information.
* $wgUseAjax is now marked as deprecated, just like the deprecated AJAX
  framework that it enables. Some extensions mistakenly used this to check
  whether any AJAX functionality at all should be enabled, further making this
  problematic to retain.

=== New features in 1.31 ===
* (T76554) User sub-pages named ….json are now protected in the same way that ….js
  and ….css pages are, so that configuration options can safely be placed there.
* Wikimedia\Rdbms\IDatabase->select() and similar methods now support
  joins with parentheses for grouping.
* As a first pass in standardizing dialog boxes across the MediaWiki product,
  Html class now provides helper methods for messageBox, successBox, errorBox and
  warningBox generation.
* (T9240) Imports will now record unknown (and, optionally, known) usernames in
  a format like "iw>Example".
* (T20209) Linker (used on history pages, log pages, and so on) will display
  usernames formed like "iw>Example" as interwiki links, as if by wikitext like
  [[iw:User:Example|iw>Example]].
* (T111605) The 'ImportHandleUnknownUser' hook allows extensions to auto-create
  users during an import.
* Added a hook, ParserOutputPostCacheTransform, to allow extensions to affect
  the ParserOutput::getText() post-cache transformations.
* Added a hook, UploadForm:getInitialPageText, to allow extensions to alter the
  initial page text for file uploads.
* (T181651) The info page for File pages now displays the file's base-16 SHA1
  hash value in the table of basic information.
* Style tags with a 'data-mw-deduplicate' attribute will be deduplicated as a
  ParserOutput::getText() post-cache transformation. This may be disabled by
  passing 'deduplicateStyles' => false to that method.
* The identity of the logged-in or IP "actor" for logged actions is being moved
  into a new actor table, with the rows in tables such as revision and logging
  referring to the actor ID instead of storing the user ID and name/IP in
  every row.
  * This is currently gated by $wgActorTableSchemaMigrationStage. Most wikis
    can set this to MIGRATION_NEW and run maintenance/migrateActors.php as
    soon as any necessary extensions are updated.
  * Most code accessing rows for logged actions from the database should use
    the relevant getQueryInfo() methods to get the information needed to build
    the SQL query. The ActorMigration class may also be used to get feature-flagged
    information needed to access actor-related fields during the migration
    period.
* Added Wikimedia\Rdbms\IDatabase::cancelAtomic(), to roll back an atomic
  section without having to roll back the whole transaction.
* Wikimedia\Rdbms\IDatabase::doAtomicSection(), non-native ::insertSelect(),
  and non-MySQL ::replace() and ::upsert() no longer roll back the whole
  transaction on failure.
* (T189785) Added a monthly heartbeat ping to the pingback feature.
* The CLI installer (maintenance/install.php) learned to detect and include
  extensions. Pass --with-extensions to enable that feature.
* (T184791) rc_patrolled now has three states: "0" for unpatrolled,
  "1" for manually patrolled and "2" for autopatrolled actions.
* Extensions can now set their type to "editor" if they provide an editor
  or enhance the editing experience.
* Extensions can use a PSR-4 autoloader by setting an "AutoloadNamespaces" property
  in extension.json. See
  <https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Extension.json/Schema#AutoloadNamespaces>
  for more details and an example.

  override DifferenceEngine::getDiffBodyCacheKeyParams() instead.
* Use of Maintenance::error( $err, $die ) to exit script was deprecated. Use
  Maintenance::fatalError() instead.

  used for that. Rather, setRef() existed as memory optimisation for PHP 4.
* QuickTemplate::setTranslator() was deprecated in favour of Skin::msg() parameters.

  from the wikimedia/object-factory library should be used instead.
* CommentStore::newKey is deprecated. Get an instance from MediaWikiServices instead.
* The following CommentStore methods have had their signatures changed to introduce a $key parameter,

  * CommentStore::getJoin
  * CommentStore::getComment
  * CommentStore::getCommentLegacy
  * CommentStore::insert
  * CommentStore::insertWithTemplate

  * Title::isJsSubpage – use ::isUserJsConfigPage
* The following methods related to caching of half-parsed HTML were deprecated:
  * Parser::serializeHalfParsedText()
  * Parser::unserializeHalfParsedText()
  * Parser::isValidHalfParsedText()
  * StripState::getSubState()
  * StripState::merge()
* The DeferredStringifier class is deprecated, use Message::listParam() instead.
* The type string for the parameter $lang of DateFormatter::getInstance is
  deprecated.
* Wikimedia\Rdbms\SavepointPostgres is deprecated.
* The DO_MAINTENANCE constant is deprecated. RUN_MAINTENANCE_IF_MAIN should be
  used instead.
* The function wfShellWikiCmd() has been deprecated, use
  MediaWiki\Shell::makeScriptCommand().

=== Other changes in 1.31 ===
* Browser support for Internet Explorer 10 was lowered from Grade A to Grade C.
* Browser support for Opera 12 and older was removed. Opera 15+ continues at Grade A.
* Introducing multi-content-revision capability into the storage layer. For details,
  see <https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Requests_for_comment/Multi-Content_Revisions>.
* The "free" CSS class is now only applied to unbracketed URLs in wikitext. Links
  written using square brackets will get the class "text" not "free".
* RFC 157418: Whitespace is trimmed from wikitext headings, wikitext list items,
  wikitext table captions, wikitext table headings, wikitext table cells. HTML
  headings, HTML list items, HTML table captions, HTML table headings, HTML table cells
  will not have this trimming behavior.

== Compatibility ==
MediaWiki 1.31 requires PHP 7.0.0 or later. Although HHVM 3.18.5 or later is supported,
it is generally advised to use PHP 7.0.0 or later for long term support.

MySQL/MariaDB is the recommended DBMS. PostgreSQL or SQLite can also be used,
but support for them is somewhat less mature. There is experimental support for
Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server.

The supported versions are:

* MySQL 5.5.8 or later
* PostgreSQL 9.2 or later
* SQLite 3.3.7 or later
* Oracle 9.0.1 or later
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 (9.00.1399)

== Upgrading ==
1.31 has several database changes since 1.30, and will not work without schema
updates. Note that due to changes to some very large tables like the revision
table, the schema update may take quite long (minutes on a medium sized site,
many hours on a large site).

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions, including
important information when upgrading from versions prior to 1.11.

For notes on 1.30.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

== Online documentation ==
Documentation for both end-users and site administrators is available on
MediaWiki.org, and is covered under the GNU Free Documentation License (except
for pages that explicitly state that their contents are in the public domain):

       https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Documentation

== Mailing list ==
A mailing list is available for MediaWiki user support and discussion:

       https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-l

A low-traffic announcements-only list is also available:

       https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-announce

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.

== IRC help ==
There's usually someone online in #mediawiki on irc.freenode.net.
