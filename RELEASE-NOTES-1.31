=== Important pre-upgrade notes for 1.31 ===
* If you're using MySQL, SQLite, or MSSQL, are not using update.php to apply
  schema changes, and cannot have downtime to run migrateArchiveText.php and
  apply patch-drop-ar_text.sql manually, you'll have to apply a default value
  to the ar_text and ar_flags columns of the archive table or make those
  columns nullable before upgrading to MediaWiki 1.31.
  maintenance/archives/patch-nullable-ar_text.sql shows how to do this for MySQL.
* The CologneBlue and Modern skins are no longer bundled with the tarball. You
  will need to remove the wfLoadSkin() calls from your LocalSettings.php or
  download them separately
  (<https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:SkinDistributor>).

=== Configuration changes in 1.31 ===
* $wgEnableAPI and $wgEnableWriteAPI are now deprecated and will be removed in
  a future version. The API is now considered to be stable, secure and
  essential.
* $wgUsejQueryThree was removed, as it is now the default. This was documented
  as a temporary variable during the migration period, deprecated since 1.29.
* $wgLogoHD has been updated to support svg images and uses $wgLogo where
  possible for fallback images such as png.
* (T44246) $wgFilterLogTypes will no longer ignore 'patrol' when user does not
  have the right to mark things patrolled.
* Wikis that contain imported revisions or CentralAuth global blocks should run
  maintenance/cleanupUsersWithNoId.php.
* The configuration settings $wgResourceLoaderMinifierStatementsOnOwnLine and
  $wgResourceLoaderMinifierMaxLineLength, deprecated since 1.27, were removed.
* (T180921) $wgReferrerPolicy now supports having fallbacks for browsers that
  are not using the latest version of the Referrer Policy specification.
* $wgFragmentMode is now set to [ 'legacy', 'html5' ] by default. This is a
  first step of migration to human-readable section IDs that will later result
  in 'html5' being the default mode.
* CACHE_ACCEL now only supports APC(u) or WinCache. XCache support was removed
  as upstream is inactive and has no plans to move to PHP 7.
* The old CategorizedRecentChanges feature, including its related configuration
  option $wgAllowCategorizedRecentChanges, has been removed.
* (T188472) The 'comma' value for $wgArticleCountMethod is no longer supported
  for performance reasons, and installations with this setting will now work as
  if it was configured with 'any'.
* (T185753) MediaWiki now defaults to using RemexHtml to tidy up user input,
  rather than being off by default. If you wish to disable HTML tidying
  entirely, set $wgTidyConfig to null; if you wish to use the old, deprecated
  Tidy external binary, both set $wgTidyConfig to null and $wgUseTidy to true.
* $wgLogAutopatrol now defaults to false instead of true.
* $wgValidateAllHtml was removed and will be ignored.
* $wgScriptExtension, deprecated and ignored since 1.25, was removed. See the
  1.25 release notes for more information.
* $wgUseAjax is now marked as deprecated, just like the deprecated AJAX
  framework that it enables. Some extensions mistakenly used this to check
  whether any AJAX functionality at all should be enabled, further making this
  problematic to retain.
* $wgDBmysql5 is now deprecated, and will be removed in a future version. It
  has been marked as experimental ever since it was introduced.
* Fix $magicWords for the Sanskrit language

=== New features in 1.31 ===
* (T76554) User sub-pages named ….json are now protected in the same way that
  ….js and ….css pages are, so that configuration options can safely be placed
  there.
* Wikimedia\Rdbms\IDatabase->select() and similar methods now support joins
  with parentheses for grouping.
* As a first pass in standardizing dialog boxes across the MediaWiki product,
  Html class now provides helper methods for messageBox, successBox, errorBox
  and warningBox generation.
* (T9240) Imports will now record unknown (and, optionally, known) usernames in
  a format like "iw>Example".
* (T20209) Linker (used on history pages, log pages, and so on) will display
  usernames formed like "iw>Example" as interwiki links, as if by wikitext like
  [[iw:User:Example|iw>Example]].
* (T111605) The 'ImportHandleUnknownUser' hook allows extensions to auto-create
  users during an import.
* Added a hook, ParserOutputPostCacheTransform, to allow extensions to affect
  the ParserOutput::getText() post-cache transformations.
* Added a hook, UploadForm:getInitialPageText, to allow extensions to alter the
  initial page text for file uploads.
* (T181651) The info page for File pages now displays the file's base-16 SHA1
  hash value in the table of basic information.
* Style tags with a 'data-mw-deduplicate' attribute will be deduplicated as a
  ParserOutput::getText() post-cache transformation. This may be disabled by
  passing 'deduplicateStyles' => false to that method.
* The identity of the logged-in or IP "actor" for logged actions is being moved
  into a new actor table, with the rows in tables such as revision and logging
  referring to the actor ID instead of storing the user ID and name/IP in
  every row.
  * This is currently gated by $wgActorTableSchemaMigrationStage. Most wikis
    can set this to MIGRATION_NEW and run maintenance/migrateActors.php as
    soon as any necessary extensions are updated.
  * Most code accessing rows for logged actions from the database should use
    the relevant getQueryInfo() methods to get the information needed to build
    the SQL query. The ActorMigration class may also be used to get feature
    -flagged information needed to access actor-related fields during the
    migration period.
* Added Wikimedia\Rdbms\IDatabase::cancelAtomic(), to roll back an atomic
  section without having to roll back the whole transaction.
* Wikimedia\Rdbms\IDatabase::doAtomicSection(), non-native ::insertSelect(),
  and non-MySQL ::replace() and ::upsert() no longer roll back the whole
  transaction on failure.
* (T189785) Added a monthly heartbeat ping to the pingback feature.
* The CLI installer (maintenance/install.php) learned to detect and include
  extensions. Pass --with-extensions to enable that feature.
* (T184791) rc_patrolled now has three states: "0" for unpatrolled,
  "1" for manually patrolled and "2" for autopatrolled actions.
* Extensions can now set their type to "editor" if they provide an editor or
  enhance the editing experience.
* Extensions can use a PSR-4 autoloader by setting an "AutoloadNamespaces"
  property in extension.json. See the documentation at
  <https://mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Extension.json/Schema#AutoloadNamespaces>
  for more details and an example.
* (T19099) Tabs which link to pages that don't exist (like those to uncreated
  discussion pages) now have a tooltip to indicate state, not just colour.

=== External library changes in 1.31 ===
* pear/mail, pear/mail_mime and pear/mail_mime-decode have been moved from

  and not via PEAR itself.

* The global function wfBCP47 is deprecated in favour of LanguageCode::bcp47.
* The global function wfCountDown is now deprecated in favor of

  Maintenance::fatalError() instead.

=== Other changes in 1.31 ===
* Browser support for Internet Explorer 10 was lowered from Grade A to Grade C.
* Browser support for Opera 12 and older was dropped entirely. Opera 15+
  continues at Grade A.
* Multi-content-revision capability was introduced into the storage layer. See
  <https://mediawiki.org/wiki/Requests_for_comment/Multi-Content_Revisions>.
* The "free" CSS class is now only applied to unbracketed URLs in wikitext.
  Links written using square brackets will get the class "text" not "free".
* RFC 157418: Whitespace is trimmed from wikitext headings, wikitext list items,
  wikitext table captions, wikitext table headings, wikitext table cells. HTML
  headings, HTML list items, HTML table captions, HTML table headings, HTML
  table cells will not have this trimming behavior.

== Compatibility ==
MediaWiki 1.31 requires PHP 7.0.13 or later. Although HHVM 3.18.5 or later is
supported, it is generally advised to use PHP 7.0.13 or later for long term
support. MediaWiki requires that the mbstring, xml, ctype, json, iconv and
fileinfo PHP extensions are loaded to work.

MySQL/MariaDB is the recommended DBMS. PostgreSQL or SQLite can also be used,
but support for them is somewhat less mature. There is experimental support for
Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server.

The supported versions are:

* MySQL 5.5.8 or later
* PostgreSQL 9.2 or later
* SQLite 3.3.7 or later
* Oracle 9.0.1 or later
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 (9.00.1399)

== Upgrading ==
1.31 has several database changes since 1.30, and will not work without schema
updates. Note that due to changes to some very large tables like the revision
table, the schema update may take quite long (minutes on a medium sized site,
many hours on a large site).

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions, including
important information when upgrading from versions prior to 1.11.

For notes on 1.30.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

== Online documentation ==
Documentation for both end-users and site administrators is available on
MediaWiki.org, and is covered under the GNU Free Documentation License (except
for pages that explicitly state that their contents are in the public domain):

       https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Documentation

== Mailing list ==
A mailing list is available for MediaWiki user support and discussion:

       https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-l

A low-traffic announcements-only list is also available:

       https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-announce

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.

== IRC help ==
There's usually someone online in #mediawiki on irc.freenode.net.
