1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:09,070
Princess Iron Fan

2
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:09,280
Journey to the West is a wonderful children's story,

3
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,280
but the world often misunderstands it as a fantasy novel.

4
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,240
This film was made for the purpose of

5
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:24,240
training the hearts and minds of children.

6
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,280
The story is pure, untainted by fantasy.

7
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,560
Fiery Mountain blocking the path of Tang Seng's company

8
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:41,039
is a metaphor for the difficulties in life.

9
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:46,439
In order to overcome them, one must keep faith.
Everybody must work together

10
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:52,430
in order to obtain the palm leaf fan and put out the flames.

11
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:58,178
Tripikata True Sutra

12
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:37,789
It's already autumn, how can it still be so warm?

13
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,349
Fool, don't talk rubbish. We should hurry and get on our way.

14
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:09,349
Wukong, where is this place?

15
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,669
We must pass through here to continue westwards, that much is certain.

16
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:18,110
Might we have taken the wrong path?

17
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:21,700
Why is it so hot here?

18
00:04:30,029 --> 00:04:31,649
Master, look!

19
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,779
Isn't that a house up ahead?

20
00:04:33,829 --> 00:04:38,100
Let's go in and rest for a while, OK?

21
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:02,899
This place is called Fiery Mountain.

22
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:06,019
The fire stretches for hundreds of miles.

23
00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:08,740
Not single straw of grass can grow here.

24
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,620
The four seasons of the year are all warm.

25
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:19,629
You couldn't pass through the mountain even with a head of copper and arms of iron.

26
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:23,579
What kind of place is this? Master, don't worry!

27
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:27,139
The three of us are all strong enough to pass!

28
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:30,699
Master, I'll go and have a look!

29
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:09,579
Wukong, what was it like?

30
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:11,819
Bad, bad, very bad.

31
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:15,910
If I were any slower the fur on my tail would have been burned off.

32
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:47,600
Noble host, the fires here are so big.

33
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,669
How can you grow any crops?

34
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:53,980
A thousand miles from here lives Princess Iron Fan.

35
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:56,500
She has a palm leaf fan.

36
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:59,070
Wave the fan once and the fire goes out.

37
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,629
Twice and the wind starts blowing.

38
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:03,980
Three times and the rain starts coming down.

39
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:07,509
In the following period we plant and harvest.

40
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:11,340
However, asking that princess to come

41
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:14,870
is certainly no simple matter.

42
00:09:14,909 --> 00:09:16,820
Where does she live?

43
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,190
She lives in Palm Leaf Cave at Emerald Cloud Mountain.

44
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,669
Does she live there alone?

45
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,750
Doesn't she have a husband?

46
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:29,580
Her husband is Bull Demon King.

47
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:32,200
What, her husband is Old Bull?

48
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,789
Fool, you know him? Come with me to borrow the fan!

49
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,750
Actually... Old Bull doesn't live there.

50
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:46,350
Looking for his woman when he isn't home

51
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,519
isn't very... appropriate.

52
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:58,309
You... you... the two of you go.

53
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:04,290
I... I'll stay here and serve Master.

54
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:11,269
Sha Wujing, go with your two fellow apprentices.

55
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:44,978
Palm Leaf Cave

56
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,549
Fool, I always go first.

57
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,350
This time it's your turn!

58
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:04,909
Junior! I always go first, this time it's your turn!

59
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,830
Senior...

60
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,990
I'm asking you to make a small effort for Master. Can't you do that?

61
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:14,309
Hurry up!

62
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:43,039
Simple monk, where did you come from?

63
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:49,870
The Great Sage... Tang Seng... wants your princess...

64
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:52,480
Nonsense!

65
00:12:47,549 --> 00:12:52,059
Senior... why don't you go instead?

66
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,950
Fool, you go!

67
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,700
Senior, why don't you go?

68
00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:07,460
Lazy fool!

69
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:57,899
Great God of Thunder! Don't kill me, let me go!

70
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,950
Go tell your princess

71
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,279
that Sun Wukong has come to borrow the fan.

72
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:08,399
Yes, yes! Let me loose, I'll go at once.

73
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:37,059
Grandma, there's a Sun Wukong outside asking to borrow the fan.

74
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,149
Quickly fetch my sword.

75
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:04,149
Sun Wukong, you hurt my son!

76
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,549
You dare come here to meet your death?

77
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,039
I've never met you before, how could I have harmed your son?

78
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:15,789
My son Red Child's life was ruined, wasn't that your doing?

79
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:20,389
Your son is with the Goddess of Mercy now, how can you say that I hurt him?

80
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,750
Enough rubbish! Come here and let me chop you with my sword.

81
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:26,149
If you can take it I'll lend you the fan.

82
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,549
Really?

83
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:00,629
Stop! Quickly give me the fan!

84
00:17:53,630 --> 00:18:00,099
Great Sage, weren't you going west? Why have you come back here?

85
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:17,140
Princess Iron Fan blew me here with a single wave of her fan.

86
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:23,859
That's truly amazing, Great Sage. I have something for you.

87
00:18:28,509 --> 00:18:33,450
This is a wind pearl. When you use it,

88
00:18:33,509 --> 00:18:36,140
your heart will become steady as a rock.

89
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:39,180
Princess Iron Fan won't be able to move you.

90
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:42,849
Great Sage, come and have a look.

91
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,539
Thank you.

92
00:19:06,069 --> 00:19:12,299
Senior... where...

93
00:19:12,349 --> 00:19:18,690
where has he... been blown to?

94
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:26,099
Who cares about him? Let the monkey handle himself. Let's go.

95
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,259
Senior... senior...

96
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:43,470
You... you...

97
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:50,220
Where were you blown to by that old lady?

98
00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:57,180
Fool, now it's definitely your turn to go.

99
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:00,930
I'm not going, a single wave of her fan

100
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,450
could blow me to some faraway land.

101
00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:09,710
Maybe it's better if you go again.

102
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,220
I won't go.

103
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:22,779
Next time I won't let you off!

104
00:20:56,150 --> 00:21:00,140
This time I won't move no matter how much you wave,

105
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:05,210
as sure as I call myself am a man!

106
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:38,579
Senior, how come this time her fan couldn't move you?

107
00:21:46,829 --> 00:21:50,099
Let's break our way in.

108
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:04,180
Quickly bring out the fan for Sun Wukong!

109
00:24:14,869 --> 00:24:16,900
Sun Wukong, where are you?

110
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:19,980
I'm in your stomach!

111
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,539
Sun Wukong, spare me!

112
00:24:48,589 --> 00:24:51,180
Only if you give me the fan!

113
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:56,539
I promise, I'll give it to you. Please come out!

114
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:02,819
Hurry up and bring the fan.

115
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,220
We've brought out the fan.

116
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,069
Why haven't you come out?

117
00:25:12,109 --> 00:25:16,619
Open your mouth and I'll come out.

118
00:25:25,349 --> 00:25:29,420
Sun Wukong, why haven't you come out?

119
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:55,579
Here I am. Lend me the fan for a while, I'll return it.

120
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:36,579
Master has been waiting long enough, let's get going!

121
00:27:01,869 --> 00:27:04,900
Scripture, what is scripture?

122
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:10,029
Scriptures are the principles that link heaven and earth.

123
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:14,180
They are the principles of man.

124
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:18,700
Only he who holds these principles

125
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:25,339
can rid himself of pain and live a good life,

126
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:29,940
live a true and honest life.

127
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,349
Conversely,

128
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:40,089
he who does not know these principles,

129
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:46,380
will live a life full of misery.

130
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:52,609
Even his son or grandson will not achieve happiness.

131
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:55,660
Why am I going to get the scripture?

132
00:27:55,710 --> 00:28:01,299
Because men nowadays are trapped in misery.

133
00:28:01,349 --> 00:28:04,180
In order to achieve this goal, we are going to

134
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:12,500
appear before the Tang emperor and discuss this very complicated matter.

135
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:17,819
Did you get the palm leaf fan?

136
00:28:17,869 --> 00:28:19,400
We have it.

137
00:28:19,401 --> 00:28:20,779
Is this it?

138
00:28:22,829 --> 00:28:27,980
Noble hosts, now that we have the fan,

139
00:28:28,029 --> 00:28:32,140
we will take our leave.

140
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:34,039
Hold on.

141
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:39,789
Everyone, I would like to ask Sage Seng to stay here for a few more days.

142
00:28:39,829 --> 00:28:41,339
Do you agree?

143
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:43,460
Agreed!

144
00:28:43,509 --> 00:28:45,890
Thank you for your kindness.

145
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:51,779
But the sooner I leave the sooner we can complete our task.

146
00:28:51,829 --> 00:28:56,180
Very well, will the honorable apprentice first go to Fiery Mountain.

147
00:28:56,230 --> 00:29:02,140
After extinguishing the flames, continue to follow Sage Seng.

148
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:05,460
All right, go ahead!

149
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:30,029
Princess Iron Fan is really despicable, she gave us a fake fan!

150
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:32,779
I'll kill her for sure!

151
00:30:32,829 --> 00:30:36,299
No, killing her is the wrong thing to do.

152
00:30:36,349 --> 00:30:39,579
I won't let you kill anyone.

153
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:42,980
Let's think of something else.

154
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:56,220
Senior, how could you be fooled by her?

155
00:30:56,269 --> 00:30:58,539
After making such an effort

156
00:30:58,589 --> 00:31:02,099
all we got was a fake fan.

157
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:06,500
Ridiculous, ridiculous.

158
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,420
Then you go!

159
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:14,380
OK, I'll go, I'll go, I'm going!

160
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:16,908
I'll go find Bull Demon King.

161
00:31:16,909 --> 00:31:19,940
This is a good solution.

162
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:24,439
Partner, what do you think?

163
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,380
We'll see how you do.

164
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:11,150
What do you think, am I pretty today?

165
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:13,779
Beautiful, my baby.

166
00:33:13,829 --> 00:33:17,059
Accompany me for a walk outside the cave, all right?

167
00:33:17,109 --> 00:33:21,539
My baby, why don't you go by yourself.

168
00:33:21,589 --> 00:33:24,819
Why of course, I'm just a plain country girl.

169
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:28,019
Taking me outside might cause you to lose face.

170
00:33:28,069 --> 00:33:32,029
Baby, what are you saying?

171
00:33:32,029 --> 00:33:37,500
You go ahead, I'll come out in a while, all right?

172
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:44,557
Emerald Cloud Cave

173
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:35,659
Goddess, you're truly an angel come down from heaven.

174
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,900
Who... who are you?

175
00:35:37,949 --> 00:35:41,460
I've come from Palm Leaf Cave to look for Bull Demon King.

176
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:43,980
Let go of me!

177
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:52,940
Goddess, slow down!

178
00:36:38,768 --> 00:36:40,133
Emerald Cloud Cave

179
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:49,219
Baby, who has bullied you?

180
00:36:49,269 --> 00:36:50,820
You!

181
00:36:50,869 --> 00:36:54,340
How could I bully you?

182
00:36:56,909 --> 00:36:59,260
Why don't you go back to Palm Leaf Cave?

183
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,699
It would spare you some embarrassment.

184
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:07,659
They often send people to look for you, and bully me.

185
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:11,059
Has there been someone here to look for me?

186
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:15,059
There's a pig monk outside looking for you.

187
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,510
He almost scared me to death.

188
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:22,739
How can this be? Wait while I go out to have a look.

189
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:53,780
Bull, old friend!

190
00:37:53,829 --> 00:37:58,139
There's a very beautiful young lady in here.

191
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:03,889
Hey, that's my woman! Why have you come to bother her?

192
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:08,550
Oh, I didn't know, please forgive me!

193
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:11,940
You didn't know, so I can't blame you. Off you go!

194
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:16,099
No, no. I still have something I need you to help me with.

195
00:38:18,469 --> 00:38:24,710
We were on our way to retrieve the scriptures when we arrived at Fiery Mountain.

196
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:27,300
Please ask your wife

197
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:30,820
to lend us the palm leaf fan for a while.

198
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,510
Absolutely not! Tang Seng and Sun Wukong

199
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:35,179
are my son's enemies.

200
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:38,739
I'd love to take my revenge on them.

201
00:38:38,789 --> 00:38:44,969
Your son is with the Goddess of Mercy now, please don't fight.

202
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:48,940
All right, since we are old friends, I won't fight you.

203
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,710
Now go away!

204
00:39:38,389 --> 00:39:44,179
Baby, that pig monk is a friend of mine.

205
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:46,500
He wasn't sent from Palm Leaf Cave at all.

206
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,739
I don't believe you.

207
00:39:47,789 --> 00:39:50,940
I'm not lying to you!

208
00:39:50,989 --> 00:39:54,019
Where is that monk now?

209
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:57,780
I've already scared him away.

210
00:43:34,814 --> 00:43:40,987
Palm Leaf Cave

211
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:01,340
The king has returned!

212
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:02,369
Where's grandma?

213
00:44:02,429 --> 00:44:04,780
She's inside.

214
00:44:42,989 --> 00:44:48,219
By what honor has the king come to visit today?

215
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:52,260
I heard that Sun Wukong and Tang Seng are coming here.

216
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:56,909
I'm afraid they want to use the palm leaf fan to pass Fiery Mountain.

217
00:44:56,949 --> 00:45:00,860
That monkey is the one who harmed our son.

218
00:45:00,909 --> 00:45:08,489
I'll get him sooner or later, we will have our revenge.

219
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:12,699
Darling, why are you crying?

220
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:15,699
That monkey has already been here.

221
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:18,860
I refused to give him the fan.

222
00:45:18,909 --> 00:45:22,260
I don't know how, but he got inside my stomach.

223
00:45:22,309 --> 00:45:25,500
It hurt so bad I thought I would die.

224
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:30,589
At last I had no choice but to give him the fan.

225
00:45:30,789 --> 00:45:35,260
That's terrible, how could you give him the fan?

226
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,469
I gave him a false one.

227
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,019
A false one?

228
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:19,860
A banquet to celebrate the king's return

229
00:46:19,909 --> 00:46:25,619
Please drink the fine wine.

230
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:34,179
The chicken is fragrant, the duck is beautiful, and the pig is fat.

231
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:45,670
I try my best to sing, I try my best to dance.

232
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:54,500
You must also try your best to drink.

233
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:16,389
My king! You dumped the old one.

234
00:47:16,429 --> 00:47:22,610
You love another woman.

235
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:34,659
Countless tears were spilled for you.

236
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:55,699
When the light is out and the curtain is dropped,

237
00:47:55,750 --> 00:48:00,869
you will sleep alone.

238
00:48:00,869 --> 00:48:05,510
You too will taste loneliness.

239
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:13,420
Pardon me for not making you company.

240
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:24,619
Even if we are on the same bed,

241
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:34,340
we will sleep under separate sheets.

242
00:48:38,389 --> 00:48:42,380
King, I'm drunk.

243
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:58,139
Darling, where did you put the real fan?

244
00:48:58,190 --> 00:49:05,460
That monkey is very deceitful, and the pig has even greater skill.

245
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:09,780
If you're not careful they might trick you.

246
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:21,980
Our treasure is right here.

247
00:49:31,429 --> 00:49:39,309
King, what are you thinking about? Why don't you take it?

248
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:40,847
My treasure.

249
00:49:41,514 --> 00:49:44,150
Emerald Cloud Cave

250
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:49,019
Baby, have another cup. Drink.

251
00:49:53,909 --> 00:49:59,510
Gold Dragon King has asked me to drink with him tonight

252
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:01,420
Then you should go.

253
00:50:01,469 --> 00:50:02,860
That's right.

254
00:50:02,909 --> 00:50:06,610
You should prepare the golden eyed beast for grandpa.

255
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,260
I will.

256
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:12,590
You should drink a little less tonight.

257
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:15,739
Otherwise I won't be able to wake you up.

258
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:19,110
It's terrible, grandpa's golden eyed beast has disappeared!

259
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:20,900
Are you all deaf and blind?

260
00:50:20,949 --> 00:50:24,030
How could it just disappear?

261
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:27,900
Baby, don't mind them.

262
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:31,710
I'm afraid Zhu Bajie might have stolen it.

263
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:35,260
Maybe I should go over to Palm Leaf Cave.

264
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:39,309
What? You've had this planned all along.

265
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:48,150
You still want to go over to that shameless woman?

266
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:50,699
Please baby, don't cry.

267
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:54,059
I'll be back soon.

268
00:50:57,624 --> 00:51:01,194
Palm Leaf Cave

269
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:07,300
Come over here, drink a little!

270
00:51:10,349 --> 00:51:12,460
Now I can relax.

271
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:16,699
We don't have to worry about our treasure being stolen.

272
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:21,300
Even if they stole it, they wouldn't know to pull the silk thread.

273
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:26,269
Having just a pearl won't be of any use.

274
00:51:26,309 --> 00:51:31,780
Pulling the thread will turn it into a fan, right?

275
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:38,070
King, you're drunk.

276
00:51:38,110 --> 00:51:44,019
You forgot about your own treasure, and are asking me.

277
00:51:49,989 --> 00:51:53,690
Lady, look at who I am.

278
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:03,750
Who are you?

279
00:52:03,789 --> 00:52:09,889
I am Tang Seng's second apprentice, Zhu Bajie.

280
00:52:09,949 --> 00:52:14,780
Sorry about bothering you, and thanks!

281
00:52:19,079 --> 00:52:21,710
Bye!

282
00:53:06,829 --> 00:53:10,699
Bull's wife is too flirtatious.

283
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:14,710
All her underlings are handsome.

284
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:24,809
Old Pig almost couldn't take it.

285
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:28,860
Using clever tricks and tactics,

286
00:53:28,909 --> 00:53:32,820
I stole their treasure away.

287
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,789
This is a great accomplishment.

288
00:53:36,829 --> 00:53:38,300
Sandy should be on his knees.

289
00:53:38,349 --> 00:53:40,730
Monkey should learn from me.

290
00:53:40,789 --> 00:53:45,219
Even Master will be astonished.

291
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:49,190
Old Pig is truly masterful.

292
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:54,349
Old Pig is truly masterful.

293
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:40,469
Fool, how are things going?

294
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:42,809
Not only did I get the fan,

295
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:48,789
Princess Iron Fan was my wife for half a day, too.

296
00:54:48,829 --> 00:54:51,699
You got a good deal.

297
00:54:58,150 --> 00:55:01,579
Hey, let me see the fan.

298
00:55:16,030 --> 00:55:20,219
Why did you shrink it?

299
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:45,340
Old Pig, you do recognize me, right?

300
00:55:45,389 --> 00:55:49,170
Stop joking around with me.

301
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:52,139
Who's joking around with you?

302
00:56:42,869 --> 00:56:45,380
Fool, how did it go?

303
00:56:45,429 --> 00:56:47,099
It was all for nothing.

304
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:49,980
Wuneng, did you borrow the fan?

305
00:56:50,030 --> 00:56:53,340
I found Bull Demon King, but he refused.

306
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:59,190
Then, I turned into his look-alike.

307
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:03,539
I tricked Princess Iron Fan into giving me the fan.

308
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:10,590
But then Old Bull turned into your look-alike and tricked me into giving it back.

309
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:12,739
Old Bull's skills are great.

310
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:16,150
I got beaten up by him, too.

311
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:21,380
How could you get the fan and still be such a fool?

312
00:57:21,429 --> 00:57:25,659
Not everything revolves around you!

313
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:34,369
Don't fight, we should quickly think of a solution.

314
00:57:34,429 --> 00:57:40,260
In which... which direction is there no fire?

315
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:47,070
Of east, south, west, north, there's fire only to the west.

316
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:50,739
So we have no option but to go back.

317
00:57:50,789 --> 00:57:52,940
This path is blocked, what other options do we have?

318
00:57:52,989 --> 00:57:55,219
Bajie, don't talk like that.

319
00:57:55,269 --> 00:57:59,139
There will always be obstacles in our path.

320
00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:04,539
To complete our sacred task we must be strong in our faith.

321
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:09,219
We can't change our goal half way just because we encounter some obstacles.

322
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:14,590
The reason that we've been defeated is that we haven't worked together.

323
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:17,139
If the three of you work as one,

324
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:20,500
put your strength together to fight Bull Demon King,

325
00:58:20,550 --> 00:58:22,849
then you will certainly be victorious.

326
00:58:22,909 --> 00:58:26,030
We have heard the order of Master

327
00:58:26,030 --> 00:58:30,139
and will fight Bull Demon King to the end.

328
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:34,260
to... to the end.

329
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:37,710
That's excellent!

330
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:40,980
We have all been through hardships.

331
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:43,869
I hope everyone will make an effort

332
00:58:43,869 --> 00:58:49,579
together with my disciples to defeat Bull Demon King and put out the flames of Fiery Mountain.

333
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:52,820
Otherwise this misery will never end.

334
00:58:53,869 --> 00:58:57,489
We have heard the order of Master, to seek happiness for all.

335
00:58:57,550 --> 00:58:58,860
Everyone work together!

336
00:58:58,909 --> 00:59:00,519
All right!

337
01:08:23,229 --> 01:08:25,609
Grandma, it's terrible!

338
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:30,789
Grandpa has been trapped, come quickly and look!

339
01:08:54,470 --> 01:08:56,699
The fight's not over yet, not over.

340
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:58,710
Careful, careful.

341
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:05,789
Beast, all you have to is give us the fan and we'll spare your life.

342
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:12,750
Old Bull, where is the fan? Hand it over!

343
01:09:12,789 --> 01:09:19,340
My... my wife... has it.

344
01:09:25,239 --> 01:09:27,989
Darling, darling!

345
01:09:28,029 --> 01:09:32,260
Save me, hurry!

346
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:35,109
Give them the fan.

347
01:09:35,149 --> 01:09:39,619
King! All right, all right!

348
01:09:43,399 --> 01:09:47,229
Wukong, you go one more time!

349
01:12:30,850 --> 01:12:46,599
The End
