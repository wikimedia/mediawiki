 *** PRELIMINARY SOFTWARE ***
 
Please note that this is a prerelease of the OMTK Flash library. No
quality of this software can be guaranteed.


 *** haXe notes ***
 
You need at least haXe 2.01 (with support for the new Flash 10 types)
to compile the haXe source.

 *** Flash notes ***
 
I am not able to create a .SWC library from the haXe .SWF file. It's
therefore dynamically linked at runtime and hxmdct.swf must be placed
in the same directory as the "real" Flash movie.
