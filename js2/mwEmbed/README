the goal of mv_embed is to create a complete/wrapper fall back system for
the liboggplay API:

http://wiki.xiph.org/index.php/OggPlayJavascriptAPI

& integrate the video element as close as possible with the html5 spec:
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#video

it attempts to wrap these calls for the following players:
I try to include a link to their Javascript apis if I can find one:

(initially just cortado and vlc)
cortado applet: a custom build of the fluendos java based applet
(included with the mv_embed package in the future we should get a signed applet hosted
so that cross domain video playing does not require a copy of cortado+iframe on that server)

vlc plugin: video lan client plugin
    http://www.videolan.org/doc/play-howto/en/ch04.html#id293992

mplayer plugin: the mplayer plugin

totem:
