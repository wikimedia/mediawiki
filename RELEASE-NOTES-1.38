== MediaWiki 1.38.0-PRERELEASE ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.38 is an alpha-quality development branch, and is not recommended
for use in production.

== Upgrading notes for 1.38 ==
Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed per-version upgrade instructions from the
oldest supported upgrading version, MediaWiki 1.29.

Some specific notes for MediaWiki 1.38 upgrades are below:
* …

For notes on 1.36.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

=== Configuration changes for system administrators in 1.38 ===
* Deprecate $wgAjaxUploadDestCheck, act as always-true
* …

==== New configuration ====
* $wgBrowserFormatDetection – This setting allows overriding browsers' automatic
  detection and handling of formats. It's initially used to prevent auto-linking
  of possible telephone numbers in wiki pages' output in Safari on iOS; this can
  be re-enabled if you wish, or locally extended for other browsers' quirks.
* (T240685) $wgMetricsTarget, $wgMetricsFormat, $wgMetricsPrefix - Configuration
  for a new MetricsFactory service with support for the dogstatsd format,
  intended for integration with Prometheus integration.
* $wgGroupInheritsPermissions – This setting allows inheriting permissions, both
  granted and revoked, from another group.
* $wgForeignApiRepos – ForeignAPIRepo now has a apiMetadataExpiry option
  to control how long file metadata is cached. Additionally the default changed
  from 1 hour to 4 hours.
* …

==== Changed configuration ====
* $wgMaxImageArea - This setting may now be set to false to disable size
  checking before scaling. Extensions can still override its value by
  using the BitmapHandlerCheckImageArea hook.
* …

==== Removed configuration ====
* $wgShellLocale - This setting has been removed as it was a flawed solution
  to the problem of locale dependence, MediaWiki will now always set a locale
  of C.UTF-8 or C and works around the remaining problems of the C locale by
  not using escapeshellarg. This follows the direction of PHP 8.0, which sets
  a locale of C by default instead of respecting LC_CTYPE.
* $wgLoggedOutMaxAge - Experiment removed, originally added in 1.35. (T293848)
* $wgIncludejQueryMigrate - Deprecated in 1.36. We only support jQuery v3.
* $wgUseCategoryBrowser - This experimental feature has been removed. If you
  still need to use this feature, please see [[mw:Extension:CategoryExplorer]].
* …

=== New user-facing features in 1.38 ===
* …

=== New developer features in 1.38 ===
* Added a deleteUserEmail maintenance script - This file enables the deletion
  of a given user's associated email address. It can be helpful for
  privacy-preserving operations.
* Description array for constructing HTMLForm now can use 'disable-if' to
  disable fields on condition easily, supported expressions are the same
  as 'hide-if'.
* …
