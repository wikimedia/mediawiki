== MediaWiki 1.38.0-PRERELEASE ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.38 is an alpha-quality development branch, and is not recommended
for use in production.

== Upgrading notes for 1.38 ==
Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed per-version upgrade instructions from the
oldest supported upgrading version, MediaWiki 1.27.

Some specific notes for MediaWiki 1.38 upgrades are below:
* …

For notes on 1.36.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

=== Configuration changes for system administrators in 1.38 ===
* …

==== New configuration ====
* $wgBrowserFormatDetection - This setting allows the enabling or disabling
of automatic detection of possible phone numbers in a webpage in Safari on iOS.
* …

==== Changed configuration ====
* $wgMaxImageArea - This setting may now be set to false to disable size
  checking before scaling. Extensions can still override its value by
  using the BitmapHandlerCheckImageArea hook.
* …

==== Removed configuration ====
* $wgShellLocale - This setting has been removed as it was a flawed solution
  to the problem of locale dependence, MediaWiki will now always set a locale
  of C.UTF-8 or C and works around the remaining problems of the C locale by
  not using escapeshellarg. This follows the direction of PHP 8.0, which sets
  a locale of C by default instead of respecting LC_CTYPE.

=== Breaking changes in 1.38 ===
* LinkCache::singleton(), deprecated since 1.28, has been removed.
* RepoGroup::singleton(), ::destroySingletons() and setSingleton(), all
  deprecated since 1.34, have been removed.
* MessageCache::singleton(), deprecated since 1.34, has been removed.
* LockManagerGroup::singleton() and ::destroySingletons(), both deprecated since
  1.34, have been removed.
* FileBackendGroup::singleton() and ::destroySingletons(), both deprecated since
  1.35, have been removed.
* TemplateParser used to support disabling the cache with a boolean parameter
  in its constructor. This was deprecated in 1.35 and has now been removed.
* The ArticleUndeleteLogEntry hook, deprecated in 1.37, was removed.
* The BeforeResetNotificationTimestamp hook, deprecated in 1.37, was removed.
* The global function mimeTypeMatch() has been removed without a deprecation
  process.
* The signature of PageUpdater::markAsRevert method was changed. It has never
  been used outside of MediaWiki core.
* If you want to use interwiki titles with HTMLTitleTextField, you now need
  to pass 'interwiki' => true. In 1.37, the default behavior was to let
  interwiki title through by default, logging a deprecation warning.
* Several Skin methods, hard deprecated in 1.36, have been removed. These
  include Skin::privacyLink(), aboutLink(), disclaimerLink(), makeUrl()
  getIndicatorsHTML(), getLogo(), subPageSubtitle(), getSearchLink(),
  makeVariablesScript(), getAllowedSkins(), getSkinNames() and
  mainPageLink(). Use Skin::footerLink for footer links instead of
  privacyLink, aboutLink and disclaimerLink. For others use
  Skin::getIndicatorsData, ResourceLoaderSkinModule::getAvailableLogos,
  Skin::prepareSubtitle,  Skin::getSearchPageTitle,
  ResourceLoader::makeInlineScript(), SkinFactory::getAllowedSkins
  or SkinFactory::getInstalledSkins().
* …

* The MWGrants class is deprecated in favor of the new GrantsInfo and
  GrantsLocalization services.
* The global functions wfReadOnly() and wfReadOnlyReason() have been
  deprecated in favor of the ReadOnlyMode service.
* Skin::getSkinStylePath has been hard deprecated. Direct string path
  should be used instead.

  deprecation warnings.
