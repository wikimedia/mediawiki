== Upgrading notes for 1.38 ==
Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed per-version upgrade instructions from the
oldest supported upgrading version, MediaWiki 1.29.

Some specific notes for MediaWiki 1.38 upgrades are below:
* (T191740) The AbuseFilter extension is now bundled with MediaWiki. This is an
  anti-abuse feature that lets privileged users to set specific actions to be
  taken when actions by users, such as edits or file uploads, match certain
  criteria.
* (T232948) The Math extension is now bundled with MediaWiki. This is a content
  feature that lets users create mathematical formulæ, written in a sub-set of
  LaTeX and rendered in MathML with a fallback SVG image. By default, it will
  use Wikimedia's mathoid service to render each formula, but local rendering
  can be set up for network isolation or performance.
* (T191743) The Minerva skin is now bundled with MediaWiki. This is a simple,
  light-weight, and scalable skin that is particularly optimised for mobile use,
  and integrates well with the MobileFrontend extension (available separately),
  but can also be used as a regular desktop skin.

For notes on 1.37.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

=== Configuration changes for system administrators in 1.38 ===

==== New configuration ====
* (T297708) $wgMaxExecutionTimeForExpensiveQueries - This setting can be used to
  control the maximum execution time for several expensive query pages (e.g.
  RecentChanges and UserContribs).
* $wgBrowserFormatDetection – This setting allows overriding browsers' automatic
  detection and handling of formats. It's initially used to prevent auto-linking
  of possible telephone numbers in wiki pages' output in Safari on iOS; this can
  be re-enabled if you wish, or locally extended for other browsers' quirks.
* (T240685) $wgMetricsTarget, $wgMetricsFormat, $wgMetricsPrefix - These provide
  configuration for a new MetricsFactory service with support for the dogstatsd
  format, intended for integration with Prometheus integration.
* $wgGroupInheritsPermissions – This setting allows inheriting permissions, both
  granted and revoked, from another group.
* $wgForeignApiRepos – ForeignAPIRepo now has a apiMetadataExpiry option to
  control for how long file metadata is cached. Additionally the default changed
  from 1 hour to 4 hours.
* $wgSkinsPreferred – This lets you set a list of preferred skins to be listed
  higher in Special:Preferences.
* $wgWikiFarmSettingsDirectory – A directory that contains site-specific
  configuration files. Setting this will enable multi-tenant ("wiki farm")
  mode, causing site-specific settings to be loaded based on information from
  the web request. EXPERIMENTAL.
* $wgWikiFarmSettingsExtension – The file extension to be used when looking up
  site-specific settings files in $wgWikiFarmSettingsDirectory, such as 'json'
  or 'yaml'. EXPERIMENTAL.
* $wgWikiFarmSiteDetector – A callback function that returns the name of the
  wiki for the current request. This is used in multi-tenant ("wiki farm")
  mode to determine which settings file to load from
  $wgWikiFarmSettingsDirectory. EXPERIMENTAL.
* $wgEnableRemoteBagOStuffTests – This replaces the environment variable
  PHPUNIT_USE_BAGOSTUFF.
* (T230211) $wgForceDeferredUpdatesPreSend – Force deferred updates to be run
  before sending a response to the client, instead of attempting to run them
  after sending the response. Setting this to true is useful for end-to-end
  testing, to ensure that the effects of a request are visible to any subsequent
  requests, even if they are made immediately after the first one. Note however
  that this does not ensure that database replication is complete, nor does it
  execute any jobs enqueued for later.
* $wgTemplateLinksSchemaMigrationStage – Templatelinks table schema migration
  stage, for normalizing tl_namespace and tl_title fields.

==== Changed configuration ====
* $wgStyleDirectory and $wgExtensionDirectory – These are now set later, so can
  no longer be used within LocalSettings.php unless explicitly set in that file.
* $wgFileBackends – This setting no longer takes 'fileJournal' as an option.
* $wgMaxImageArea - This setting may now be set to false to disable size.
  checking before scaling. Extensions can still override its value by using the
  BitmapHandlerCheckImageArea hook.
* $wgAjaxUploadDestCheck – This is now deprecated, and act as always-true.
* $wgInterwikiCache – This no longer supports the string value for CDB files.
* $wgParserOutputHooks – This is now deprecated; adjustments using this should
  be done with OutputPageParserOutputHook instead. (T292321)
* $wgExternalStores – This is newly documentated in
  includes/externalstore/README.md.

==== Removed configuration ====
* $wgShellLocale - This setting has been removed as it was a flawed solution to
  the problem of locale dependence, MediaWiki will now always set a locale of
  C.UTF-8 or C and works around the remaining problems of the C locale by not
  using escapeshellarg. This follows the direction of PHP 8.0, which sets a
  locale of C by default instead of respecting LC_CTYPE.
* $wgLoggedOutMaxAge - Experiment removed, originally added in 1.35. (T293848)
* $wgIncludejQueryMigrate - Deprecated in 1.36. We only support jQuery v3.
* $wgUseCategoryBrowser - This experimental feature has been removed. If you
  still need to use this feature, please see [[mw:Extension:CategoryExplorer]].
* $wgStyleSheetPath - alias for $wgStylePath, deprecated since 1.3 (2004).

=== User-facing changes in 1.38 ===
* (T284921) The "auto-number headings" feature was removed following a
  consultation, due to performance reasons.

=== New operator/developer features in 1.38 ===
* EXPERIMENTAL: The environment variable MW_CONFIG_FILE can be used to specify
  the location of the settings file. This allows alternative settings files to
  be loaded depending on the environment. Settings files may be given as PHP
  files like the traditional LocalSettings.php file, or they may use JSON or
  YAML format.
  See https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:YAML_settings_file_format
* Added a deleteUserEmail maintenance script - This file enables the deletion of
  a given user's associated email address. It can be helpful for
  privacy-preserving operations.
* The description array for constructing an HTMLForm now can use 'disable-if' to
  disable fields on condition easily, supported expressions are the same as
  'hide-if'.
* There is a new interface, IForeignRepoWithMWApi, to allows you to mark file
  repos provided by an extension as supporting making API queries against the
  foreign file repo so that extensions like TimedMediaHandler that depend on
  this can stop hard-coding looking for specific class names.
* Added EXPERIMENTAL support for an easy to configure multi-tenant ("wiki
  farm") mode:
  Settings for each site can be placed in a directory specified by
  $wgWikiFarmSettingsDirectory. Site detection is controlled by
  $wgWikiFarmSiteDetector and defaults to the requested host name.
  For example, setting $wgWikiFarmSettingsDirectory = "sites" would cause
  the settings for wiki.example.com to be loaded from
  "sites/wiki_example_com.yaml".
  WARNING: YAML files under the web root may be accessible to browsers, please
  take appropriate measures to protect them from access via HTTP.
* Running QUnit tests for an individual test suite module is possible with
  `grunt qunit --qunit-component={componentName}`, where {componentName} is
  "MediaWiki" to run core's QUnit tests or the skin or extension name.
* The 'mediawiki.mixins' module now has a `.user-select()` Less mixin.

* Message::content() now triggers deprecation warnings.
* Parser::setDefaultSort(), Parser::getDefaultSort(), and
  Parser::getCustomDefaultSort() now trigger deprecation warnings. Use
  ParserOutput::{get,set}PageProperty('defaultsort') instead.
* The following methods from the ParserOutput class now emit deprecation
  warnings:
   - ::hideNewSection()      - use ::setHideNewSection()
   - ::preventClickjacking() - use ::{get,set}PreventClickjacking()
   - ::getProperty()         - use ::getPageProperty() (return value changed)
   - ::setProperty()         - use ::setPageProperty()
   - ::unsetProperty()       - use ::unsetPageProperties()
   - ::getProperties()       - use ::getPageProperties()
   - ::getCategoryLinks()    - use ::getCategoryNames()
   - ::setCategoryLinks()    - use ::setCategories()
   - ::addTrackingCategory() - use Parser::addTrackingCategory()
                               or TrackingCategories::addTrackingCategory()
   - ::addWarning()          - use ::addWarningMsg()
   - ::hasDynamicContent()   - use ::hasReducedExpiry()
* The following methods from the ParserOutput class were deprecated:
   - ::getFlag() - use ::getOutputFlag()
   - ::setFlag() - use ::setOutputFlag()
   - ::getAllFlags() - this method is now marked @internal
   - ::addJsConfigVars() - use ::setJsConfigVar() or ::appendJsConfigVar()
   - ::addOutputHook() / ::getOutputHooks() - these hooks should be migrated
     to use the OutputPageParserOutput hook instead
* The use of ParserOutput::setExtensionData() to overwrite previous values
  stored under a given key has been deprecated; use the new
  ::appendExtensionData() to collect multiple values in the ParserOutput rather
  than destructively updating stored values. (T300981)
* The signatures of the following methods from the ParserOutput class were
  narrowed, restricting the permitted argument types:
  - ::addModules() - if you formerly passed a string, pass an array with
     the string as the only element.
   - ::addModuleStyles() - if you formerly passed a string, pass an array
     with the string as the only element.
* Access to the following public or protected properties of OutputPage was
  deprecated; they will be made private or removed in a future release.
  Use accessor functions instead.
  - ::$mCategoryLinks
  - ::$mCategories
  - ::$mIndicators
  - ::$mHeadItems
  - ::$mModules
  - ::$mModuleStyles
  - ::$mJsConfigVars
  - ::$mTemplateIds
  - ::$mEnableClientCache
  - ::$mNewSectionLink
  - ::$mHideNewSectionLink
  - ::$mNoGallery
* The following methods were deprecated; use ::setPreventClickjacking(..)
  instead:
   - OutputPage::preventClickjacking()
   - OutputPage::allowClickjacking()
   - ImageHistoryList::preventClickjacking()
   - ImageHistoryPseudoPager::preventClickjacking()
   - ContribsPager::preventClickjacking()
* OutputPage::enableClientCache() was deprecated, because it is universally used
  to do the opposite -- use OutputPage::disableClientCache() instead.
* Sanitizer::removeHTMLtags() has been deprecated. Its output can include
  unbalanced or ill-formed HTML and thus external callers may be misled about
  how to safely incorporate its output into a page. It is recommended to use the
  new Sanitizer::removeSomeTags() method instead, which will always return
  balanced HTML.
* EventRelayerKafka was deprecated. To use $wgEventRelayerConfig with Kafka,
  add a similar class to your code.
* MediaWiki\Logger\Monolog\KafkaHandler was deprecated. Consider using
  $wgMWLoggerDefaultSpi with SyslogHandler, or to use Kafka, add a similar
  Monolog handler class to your code.

  now deprecated in favour of the new `wikipage.watchlistChange` hook.
* The global function wfLogProfilingData() has been deprecated without a
  replacement. The logic has been moved to the MediaWiki class.
* The "trace" option of SectionProfiler has been deprecated.
* The PageArchive class has had several methods deprecated. The replacements are
  as follows:
   - Use UndeletePage instead of ::undeleteAsUser(), ::getFileStatus() and
     ::getRevisionStatus().
   - Use the respective methods of the new ArchivedRevisionLookup service
     instead of ::listRevisions, ::getRevisionRecordByTimestamp,
     ::getArchivedRevisionRecord, ::getPreviousRevisionRecord and
     ::getLastRevisionId.
   - Use ArchivedRevisionLookup::hasArchivedRevisions instead of ::isDeleted.
* PageUpdater::isUnchanged() has been deprecated, use wasRevisionCreated()
  instead.

* Access to all public properties in LinksUpdate was deprecated.
* The global variable $IP has been deprecated for use in application logic.
  It will remain available for use in LocalSettings.php for now, though
  $wgBaseDirectory is preferred.
  Application logic should use the BaseDirectory setting from the main config.
  Tests and framework code that need to function without MediaWiki being
  fully initialized should use the MW_INSTALL_PATH constant.
* The global function wfWikiID(), deprecated since 1.35, now emits deprecation
  warnings.
* AbstractBlock::getBy() now takes a wikiId as a parameter and emits deprecation
  warnings in case of cross-wiki accesses.
* The `button` parameter for `bindUpdateAriaExpandedOnInput` and
  `updateAriaExpanded` in checkboxHack.js have been deprecated.
  `bindToggleOnSpaceEnter` has also been deprecated in favor of
  `bindToggleOnEnter`.
* IDatabase::lockTables() and IDatabase::unlockTables() have been deprecated
  with no replacement. Instead, callers should batch updates into atomic
  transactions, using FOR UPDATE for SELECT queries.
* EditPage::addNewLineAtEnd() was deprecated; use
  TextboxBuilder::addNewLineAtEnd instead.
* EditPage::getCopywarn() was deprecated; use EditPage::getCopyrightWarning
  instead.
* EditPage::getCopyrightWarning() without passing a MessageLocalizer parameter

* The HTMLForm methods getPreText, setPreText, addPreText, getPostText,
  setPostText, addPostText, getHeaderText, setHeaderText, addHeaderText,
  getFooterText, setFooterText and addFooterText have been renamed to
  getPreHtml, setPreHtml, addPreHtml, getPostHtml, setPostHtml, addPostHtml,
  getHeaderHtml, setHeaderHtml, addHeaderHtml, getFooterHtml, setFooterHtml and
  addFooterHtml respectively.
* The FormSpecialPage methods preText and postText have been renamed to preHtml
  and postHtml respectively.
* Article::doDelete, deprecated in 1.37, now emits deprecation notices.
* The following Less mediawiki.mixins have been deprecated:
  - .background-image()
  - .list-style-image()
* Category::getPageCount now takes a parameter. Category::COUNT_ALL_MEMBERS
  return count of all members while Category::COUNT_CONTENT_PAGES return that

=== Other changes in 1.38 ===
* The following things were changed in the file deletion form:
   - The name and ID of the submit button are now `wpConfirmB`, not
      `mw-filedelete-submit`
   - The ID of the form is now `deleteconfirm`, not `mw-img-deleteconfirm`
   - The `mw-filedelete-editreasons` class was replaced with
     `mw-delete-editreasons`
  The goal of these changes is to make the HTML more similar to that of
  normal page deletion.
* ParserOptions created with ::newFrom* or ::newCanonical are now identical.
* MediaWiki initialization order have been changed to load vendor autoload
  earlier. This means that extensions that are installed via composer and
  execute code upon autoloading can not depend on any MediaWiki classes,
  constants or globals in that code.
* The source of truth for configuration defaults is now the MainConfigSchema
  class. DefaultSettings.php still exists for backwards compatibility. A PHP
  file generated for optimized loading will be used in Setup.php to initialize
  configuration variables. Setup.php can be made to load DefaultSettings.php
  as before by setting MW_USE_LEGACY_DEFAULT_SETTINGS as  an environment
  variable (e.g. via SetEnv in htaccess) or a PHP constant (e.g. via
  auto_prepend_file in php.ini).

== Compatibility ==
MediaWiki 1.38 requires PHP 7.3.19 or later and the following PHP extensions:

* ctype
* dom
* fileinfo
* iconv
* intl
* json
* mbstring
* xml

MySQL/MariaDB is the recommended DBMS. PostgreSQL or SQLite can also be used,
but support for them is somewhat less mature.

The supported versions are:

* MySQL 5.5.8 or later
* PostgreSQL 9.4 or later
* SQLite 3.8.0 or later

== Online documentation ==
Documentation for both end-users and site administrators is available on
MediaWiki.org, and is covered under the GNU Free Documentation License (except
for pages that explicitly state that their contents are in the public domain):

       https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Documentation

== Mailing list ==
A mailing list is available for MediaWiki user support and discussion:

       https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-l

A low-traffic announcements-only list is also available:

       https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-announce

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.

== IRC help ==
There's usually someone online in #mediawiki on irc.libera.chat.
