/** 
 * This file is the entry point for all API queries. It begins by checking 
 * whether the API is enabled on this wiki; if not, it informs the user that
 * s/he should set $wgEnableAPI to true and exits. Otherwise, it constructs
 * a new ApiMain using the parameter passed to it as an argument in the URL
 * ('?action=') and with write-enabled set to the value of $wgEnableWriteAPI
 * as specified in LocalSettings.php. It then invokes "execute()" on the
 * ApiMain object instance, which produces output in the format sepecified
 * in the URL.
