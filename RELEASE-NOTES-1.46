=== Bug fixes in 1.46 ===

* …

=== Action API changes in 1.46 ===

* In the `action=parse` API endpoint, the value `prop=sections` has been

=== Languages updated in 1.46 ===
MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated regularly.
Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as changes to languages
because of Phabricator reports.

* …

=== Breaking changes in 1.46 ===

* The SpecialWatchlistGetNonRevisionTypesHook has been removed. Instead,
  extensions should ensure that rc_this_oldid is set to zero on recent changes
  entries that do not relate to any particular revision.
* MutableRevisionRecord::setSha1() has been removed without deprecation.
* Passing something other than an Authority for the $performer parameter to
  WatchlistManager methods clearTitleUserNotifications() and
  clearAllUserNotifications, deprecated since 1.37, will now throw. User
  implements Authority and so is still permitted.
* Passing something other than a PageReference for the $title parameter to
  WatchlistManager::getTitleNotificationTimestamp and
  clearTitleUserNotifications, deprecated since 1.37, will now throw.
* Many WatchedItemStore methods took either PageIdentity or LinkTarget, with
  LinkTarget being deprecated since 1.37. Passing a LinkTarget which is not a
  PageReference will now throw.
* The following methods of SpecialUserRights, deprecated in 1.45, have been
  removed: userCanChangeRights, expiryToTimestamp, doSaveUserGroups,
  fetchUser, changeableGroups. Callers should now use the equivalent methods
  from UserGroupAssignmentService or MultiFormatUserIdentityLookup.
* UserGroupsSpecialPage::canProcessExpiries (formerly
  SpecialUserRights::canProcessExpiries), deprecated in 1.45, has been removed.
  There's no replacement; the special page always assumes it can process
  expiries.
* …

=== Deprecations in 1.46 ===

* Using an int for the $mode parameter of LanguageFallback::getAll() is now
  deprecated.  Use the new LanguageFallbackMode enumeration instead.
* LanguageFallback::MESSAGES and LanguageFallback::STRICT are deprecated; use
  LanguageFallbackModes::{MESSAGES,STRICT} instead.
* The AutopromoteCondition hook has been deprecated. Use
  UserRequirementsCondition hook, instead.
* …
