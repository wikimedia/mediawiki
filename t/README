=head1 NAME

F<t> - MediaWiki test tree

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the MediaWiki test tree (well, one of them), tests in this
directory are self-contained programs that produce TAP output via the
F<Test.php> module (/trunk/Test/Test.php) (see
http://search.cpan.org/~petdance/TAP-1.00/TAP.pm#THE_TAP_FORMAT for
information on the TAP format).

=head1 Running the tests

You'll need F<Test.php> to run the tests, it lives in the
F<trunk/Test> directory and can be copied or linked to the F<phase3>
directory.

    ln -s ../Test/Test.php .

Since the tests are self-contained PHP programs you can run them
(Xml.t here) as:

    php t/inc/Xml.t

That'll give you the raw TAP output, but what you probably want is to
use a TAP formatter such as L<prove(1)>:

    prove t/inc/Xml.t # add -v for the verbose version

or to run all the tests:

   prove -r t

=head1 TODO

=over

=item *

Rewrite the rest of the F<tests/> stuff to use L<Test.php> and move it
here

=item *

Make the parsertests use TAP?

=item *

Write unit tests for the entire codebase:)
