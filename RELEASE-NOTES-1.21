have it on, turn it '''off''' if you can.

== MediaWiki 1.21 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.21 is an alpha-quality branch and is not recommended for use in
production.

=== Configuration changes in 1.21 ===
* (bug 29374) $wgVectorUseSimpleSearch is now enabled by default.
* Deprecated $wgAllowRealName is removed. Use $wgHiddenPrefs[] = 'realname'
  instead.

=== New features in 1.21 ===
* (bug 38110) Schema changes (adding or dropping tables, indicies and
  fields) can be now be done separately from from other changes that
  update.php makes.  This is useful in environments that use database
  permissions to restrict schema changes but allow the DB user that
  MediaWiki normally runs as to perform other changes that update.php
  makes.  Schema changes can be run seperately.  See the file UPGRADE
  for more information.
* (bug 34876) jquery.makeCollapsible has been improved in performance.
* Added ContentHandler facility to allow extensions to support other content
  than wikitext. See docs/contenthandler.txt for details.
* New feature was developed for showing high-DPI thumbnails for high-DPI mobile
  and desktop displays (configurable with $wgResponsiveImages).
* Added new backend to represent and store information about sites and site
  specific configuration.
* jQuery upgraded from 1.8.2 to 1.8.3.
* jQuery UI upgraded from 1.8.23 to 1.8.24.
* Added separate fa_sha1 field to filearchive table. This allows sha1
  searches with the api in miser mode for deleted files.
* Add initial and programmatic sorting for tablesorter.
* Add the event "sortEnd.tablesorter", triggered after sorting has completed.
* The Job system was refactored to allow for different backing stores for
  queues as well as cross-wiki access to queues, among other things. The schema
  for the DB queue was changed to support better concurrency and reduce
  deadlock errors.
* Added ApiQueryORM class to facilitate creation of query API modules based on
  tables that have a corresponding ORMTable class.
* (bug 40876) Icon for PSD (Adobe Photoshop) file types.
* (bug 40641) Implemented Special:Version/Credits with a list of contributors.
* (bug 7851) Implemented one-click AJAX patrolling.
* The <data>, <time>, <meta>, and <link> elements are allowed within WikiText
  for use with Microdata.
* The HTML5 <mark> tag has been whitelisted.
* Added ParserCloned hook for when the Parser object is cloned.
* Added AlternateEditPreview hook to allow extensions to replace the page
  preview from the edit page.
* Added EditPage::showStandardInputs:options hook to allow extensions to add
  new fields to the "editOptions" area of the edit form.
* Upload stash DB schema altered to improve upload performance.
* The following global functions are now reporting deprecated warnings in
  debug mode: wfMsg, wfMsgNoTrans, wfMsgForContent, wfMsgForContentNoTrans,
  wfMsgReal, wfMsgGetKey, wfMsgHtml, wfMsgWikiHtml, wfMsgExt, wfEmptyMsg. Use
  the Message class, or the global method wfMessage.
* Debug message emitted by wfDebugLog() will now be prefixed with the group
  name when its logged to the default log file. That is the case whenever the
  group has no key in wgDebugLogGroups, that will help triage the default log.

=== Bug fixes in 1.21 ===
* (bug 40353) SpecialDoubleRedirect should support interwiki redirects.
* (bug 40352) fixDoubleRedirects.php should support interwiki redirects.
* (bug 9237) SpecialBrokenRedirect should not list interwiki redirects.
* (bug 34960) Drop unused fields rc_moved_to_ns and rc_moved_to_title from
  recentchanges table.
* (bug 32951) Do not register internal externals with absolute protocol,
  when server has relative protocol.
* (bug 39005) When purging proxies listed in $wgSquidServers using HTTP PURGE
  method requests, we now send a Host header by default, for Varnish
  compatibility. This also works with Squid in reverse-proxy mode. If you wish
  to support Squid configured in forward-proxy mode, set
  $wgSquidPurgeUseHostHeader to false.
* (bug 37020) sql.php with readline eats semicolon.
* (bug 11748) Properly handle optionally-closed HTML tags when Tidy is
  disabled, and don't wrap HTML-syntax definition lists in paragraphs.
* (bug 41409) Diffs while editing an old revision should again diff against the
  current revision.
* (bug 41494) Honor $wgLogExceptionBacktrace when logging non-API exceptions
  caught during API execution.
* (bug 37963) Fixed loading process for user options.
* (bug 26995) Update filename field on Upload page after having sanitized it.
* (bug 41793) Contribution links to users with 0 edits on Special:ListUsers
  didn't show up red.
* (bug 41899) A PHP notice no longer occurs when using the "rvcontinue" API
  parameter.
* (bug 42036) Account creation emails now contain canonical (not
  protocol-relative) URLs.
* (bug 41990) Fix regression: API edit with redirect=true and lacking
  starttimestamp and basetimestamp should not cause an edit conflict.
* (bug 41706) EditPage: Preloaded page should be converted if possible and
  needed.
* (bug 41886) Rowspans are no longer exploded by tablesorter until the table is
  actually sorted.
* (bug 2865)  User interface HTML elements don't use lang attribute
  (completed the fix by adding the lang attribute to firstHeading).
* (bug 42173) Removed namespace prefixes on Special:UncategorizedCategories.
* (bug 36053) Log in "returnto" feature forgets query parameters if no
  title parameter was specified.
* (bug 42410) API action=edit now returns correct timestamp for the new edit.
* (bug 14901) Email notification mistakes log action for new page creation.
  Enotif no longer sends "page has been created" notifications for some log
  actions. The following events now have a correct message: page creation,
  deletion, move, restore (undeletion), change (edit).
* (bug 457) In the sidebar of Vector, CologneBlue, Monobook, and Monobook-based
  skins, the heading levels have been changed from (variously per skin)
  <h4>, <h5> or <h6> to only <h3>s, with a <h2> hidden heading above them.
  If you are styling or scripting the headings in a custom way, this change
  will require updates to your site's CSS or JS.

=== API changes in 1.21 ===
* prop=revisions can now report the contentmodel and contentformat.
  See docs/contenthandler.txt.
* action=edit and action=parse now support contentmodel and contentformat
  parameters to control the interpretation of page content.
  See docs/contenthandler.txt for details.
* (bug 35693) ApiQueryImageInfo now suppresses errors when unserializing metadata.
* (bug 40111) Disable minor edit for page/section creation by API.
* (bug 41042) Revert change to action=parse&page=... behavior when the page
  does not exist.
* (bug 27202) Add timestamp sort to list=allimages.

=== Languages updated in 1.21 ===

MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated
regularly. Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as
changes to languages because of Bugzilla reports.

* South Azerbaijani (azb) added.
* (bug 30040) Autonym for nds-nl is now 'Nedersaksies' (was 'Nedersaksisch').
* (bug 34977) Now formatted numbers in Spanish use space as separator
  for thousands, as mandated by the Real Academia Espa√±ola.
* (bug 35031) Kurdish formatted numbers now use period and comma
  as separators for thousands and decimals respectively.

=== Other changes in 1.21 ===

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.21 requires PHP 5.3.2 or later.

MySQL is the recommended DBMS. PostgreSQL or SQLite can also be used, but
support for them is somewhat less mature. There is experimental support for IBM
DB2 and Oracle.

The supported versions are:

* MySQL 5.0.2 or later
* PostgreSQL 8.3 or later
* SQLite 3.3.7 or later
* Oracle 9.0.1 or later

== Upgrading ==

1.21 has several database changes since 1.20, and will not work without schema
updates. Note that due to changes to some very large tables like the revision
table, the schema update may take quite long (minutes on a medium sized site,
many hours on a large site).

If upgrading from before 1.11, and you are using a wiki as a commons
repository, make sure that it is updated as well. Otherwise, errors may arise
due to database schema changes.

If upgrading from before 1.7, you may want to run refreshLinks.php to ensure
new database fields are filled with data.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, some major database
changes are made, and there is a slightly higher chance that things could
break. Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.

For notes on 1.19.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

== Online documentation ==

Documentation for both end-users and site administrators is available on
MediaWiki.org, and is covered under the GNU Free Documentation License (except
for pages that explicitly state that their contents are in the public domain):

	https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Documentation

== Mailing list ==

A mailing list is available for MediaWiki user support and discussion:

	https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-l

A low-traffic announcements-only list is also available:

	https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-announce

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.

== IRC help ==

There's usually someone online in #mediawiki on irc.freenode.net.
