have it on, turn it '''off''' if you can.

== MediaWiki 1.21 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.21 is an alpha-quality branch and is not recommended for use in
production.

=== Configuration changes in 1.21 ===
* (bug 29374) $wgVectorUseSimpleSearch is now enabled by default.
* Deprecated $wgAllowRealName is removed. Use $wgHiddenPrefs[] = 'realname'
  instead.

=== New features in 1.21 ===
* (bug 34876) jquery.makeCollapsible has been improved in performance.
* Added ContentHandler facility to allow extensions to support other content than wikitext.
  See docs/contenthandler.txt for details.
* New feature was developed for showing high-DPI thumbnails for high-DPI mobile
  and desktop displays (configurable with $wgResponsiveImages).
* Added new backend to represent and store information about sites and site
  specific configuration.
* jQuery UI upgraded from 1.8.23 to 1.8.24.
* Added separate fa_sha1 field to filearchive table. This allows sha1
  searches with the api in miser mode for deleted files.
* Add initial and programmatic sorting for tablesorter.
* Add the event "sortEnd.tablesorter", triggered after sorting has completed.
* The Job system was refactored to allow for different backing stores for queues
  as well as cross-wiki access to queues, among other things. The schema for the
  DB queue was changed to support better concurrency and reduce deadlock errors.
* Added ApiQueryORM class to facilitate creation of query API modules based on
  tables that have a corresponding ORMTable class.
* (bug 40876) Icon for PSD (Adobe Photoshop) file types.
* (bug 40641) Implemented Special:Version/Credits with a list of contributors.

* (bug 39005) When purging proxies listed in $wgSquidServers using HTTP PURGE 
  method requests, we now send a Host header by default, for Varnish 
  compatibility. This also works with Squid in reverse-proxy mode. If you wish 
  to support Squid configured in forward-proxy mode, set 
  $wgSquidPurgeUseHostHeader to false.

=== Languages updated in 1.21 ===

MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated
regularly. Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as
changes to languages because of Bugzilla reports.
=== Other changes in 1.21 ===

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.21 requires PHP 5.3.2 or later.

MySQL is the recommended DBMS. PostgreSQL or SQLite can also be used, but
support for them is somewhat less mature. There is experimental support for IBM
DB2 and Oracle.

The supported versions are:

* MySQL 5.0.2 or later
* PostgreSQL 8.3 or later
* SQLite 3.3.7 or later
* Oracle 9.0.1 or later

== Upgrading ==

1.21 has several database changes since 1.20, and will not work without schema
updates. Note that due to changes to some very large tables like the revision
table, the schema update may take quite long (minutes on a medium sized site,
many hours on a large site).

If upgrading from before 1.11, and you are using a wiki as a commons
repository, make sure that it is updated as well. Otherwise, errors may arise
due to database schema changes.

If upgrading from before 1.7, you may want to run refreshLinks.php to ensure
new database fields are filled with data.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, some major database
changes are made, and there is a slightly higher chance that things could
break. Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.

For notes on 1.19.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

A mailing list is available for MediaWiki user support and discussion:

A low-traffic announcements-only list is also available:

	https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-announce

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.

== IRC help ==

There's usually someone online in #mediawiki on irc.freenode.net.
