have it on, turn it '''off''' if you can.

== MediaWiki 1.21 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.21 is an alpha-quality branch and is not recommended for use in
production.

=== Configuration changes in 1.21 ===
* (bug 29374) $wgVectorUseSimpleSearch is now enabled by default.
* Deprecated $wgAllowRealName is removed. Use $wgHiddenPrefs[] = 'realname'
  instead.

=== New features in 1.21 ===
* (bug 34876) jquery.makeCollapsible has been improved in performance.
* Added ContentHandler facility to allow extensions to support other content than wikitext.
  See docs/contenthandler.txt for details.
* New feature was developed for showing high-DPI thumbnails for high-DPI mobile
  and desktop displays (configurable with $wgResponsiveImages).
* Added new backend to represent and store information about sites and site
  specific configuration.
* jQuery UI upgraded from 1.8.23 to 1.8.24.
* Added separate fa_sha1 field to filearchive table. This allows sha1
  searches with the api in miser mode for deleted files.

=== Bug fixes in 1.21 ===
* (bug 40353) SpecialDoubleRedirect should support interwiki redirects.
* (bug 40352) fixDoubleRedirects.php should support interwiki redirects.
* (bug 9237) SpecialBrokenRedirect should not list interwiki redirects.
* (bug 34960) Drop unused fields rc_moved_to_ns and rc_moved_to_title from
  recentchanges table.
* (bug 32951) Do not register internal externals with absolute protocol,
  when server has relative protocol.
* (bug 39005) When purging proxies listed in $wgSquidServers using HTTP PURGE 
  method requests, we now send a Host header by default, for Varnish 
  compatibility. This also works with Squid in reverse-proxy mode. If you wish 
  to support Squid configured in forward-proxy mode, set 
  $wgSquidPurgeUseHostHeader to false.

=== API changes in 1.21 ===
* prop=revisions can now report the contentmodel and contentformat, see docs/contenthandler.txt
* action=edit and action=parse now support contentmodel and contentformat parameters to control the interpretation of
  page content; See docs/contenthandler.txt for details.
* (bug 35693) ApiQueryImageInfo now suppresses errors when unserializing metadata.
* (bug 40111) Disable minor edit for page/section creation by API

=== Languages updated in 1.21 ===

MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated
regularly. Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as
changes to languages because of Bugzilla reports.
=== Other changes in 1.21 ===

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.21 requires PHP 5.3.2 or later.

MySQL is the recommended DBMS. PostgreSQL or SQLite can also be used, but
support for them is somewhat less mature. There is experimental support for IBM
DB2 and Oracle.

The supported versions are:

* MySQL 5.0.2 or later
* PostgreSQL 8.3 or later
* SQLite 3.3.7 or later
* Oracle 9.0.1 or later

== Upgrading ==

1.21 has several database changes since 1.20, and will not work without schema
updates. Note that due to changes to some very large tables like the revision
table, the schema update may take quite long (minutes on a medium sized site,
many hours on a large site).

If upgrading from before 1.11, and you are using a wiki as a commons
repository, make sure that it is updated as well. Otherwise, errors may arise
due to database schema changes.

If upgrading from before 1.7, you may want to run refreshLinks.php to ensure
new database fields are filled with data.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, some major database
changes are made, and there is a slightly higher chance that things could
break. Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.

For notes on 1.19.x and older releases, see HISTORY.
