  instead.
* (T197179) In OOUI HTMLForm fields, the parameters 'notice', 'notice-messages',
  and 'notice-message', which were deprecated in 1.32, were removed. Instead,
  use 'help', 'help-message', and 'help-messages'.
* (T197179) HTMLFormField::getNotices(), deprecated in 1.32, was removed.
* The "Parsoid v1" compatibility mappings in ParsoidVirtualRESTService and
  RestbaseVirtualRESTService, deprecated since 1.26, have been removed.
  Use the RESTBase v1 or Parsoid v3 API instead.

=== Deprecations in 1.33 ===
* The configuration option $wgUseESI has been deprecated, and is expected
  to be removed in a future release.
* The configuration option $wgSquidPurgeUseHostHeader has been deprecated,
  and is expected to be removed in a future release.
* The configuration options $wgFixArabicUnicode and $wgFixMalayalamUnicode,
  introduced in MW 1.17, have been deprecated.  These fixes will always be
  applied for Arabic and Malayalam in the future.  Please enable these on
  your local wiki (if you have them explicitly set to false) and run
  maintenance/cleanupTitles.php to fix any existing page titles.
* The LegacyHookPreAuthenticationProvider class, deprecated since its creation
  in 1.27 as part of the AuthManager re-write, now emits deprecation warnings.
  This will help identify the issue if you added it to $wgAuthManagerConfig.

== Compatibility ==
MediaWiki 1.33 requires PHP 7.0.0 or later. Although HHVM 3.18.5 or later is
supported, it is generally advised to use PHP 7.0.0 or later for long term
support.

MySQL/MariaDB is the recommended DBMS. PostgreSQL or SQLite can also be used,
but support for them is somewhat less mature. There is experimental support for
Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server.

The supported versions are:

* MySQL 5.5.8 or later
* PostgreSQL 9.2 or later
* SQLite 3.3.7 or later
* Oracle 9.0.1 or later
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 (9.00.1399)

== Upgrading ==
1.33 has several database changes since 1.32, and will not work without schema
updates. Note that due to changes to some very large tables like the revision
table, the schema update may take quite long (minutes on a medium sized site,
many hours on a large site).

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions, including
important information when upgrading from versions prior to 1.11.

For notes on 1.32.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

== Online documentation ==

MediaWiki.org, and is covered under the GNU Free Documentation License (except

== Mailing list ==
A mailing list is available for MediaWiki user support and discussion:

       https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-l

A low-traffic announcements-only list is also available:

       https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-announce

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.

== IRC help ==
There's usually someone online in #mediawiki on irc.freenode.net.
