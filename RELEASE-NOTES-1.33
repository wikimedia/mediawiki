== MediaWiki 1.33 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.33 is an alpha-quality branch and is not recommended for use in
production.

=== Configuration changes in 1.33 ===

==== New configuration ====
* $wgEnablePartialBlocks – This enables the Partial Blocks feature, which gives
  accounts with block permissions the ability to block users, IPs, and IP ranges
  from editing specific pages, while allowing them to edit the rest of the wiki.
* $wgMediaInTargetLanguage – whether multilingual images should be dispalyed in
  the current parse language where available.

==== Changed configuration ====
* Some external link searches will not work correctly until update.php (or
  refreshExternallinksIndex.php) is run. These include searches for links using
  IP addresses, internationalized domain names, and possibly mailto links.
* (T193868) $wgChangeTagsSchemaMigrationStage — This temporary setting, added in
  MediaWiki 1.32, now defaults to MIGRATION_NEW instead of MIGRATION_WRITE_BOTH.

==== Removed configuration ====
* (T199334) $wgTagStatisticsNewTable — This temporary setting, added in
  MediaWiki 1.32, has now been removed. When loading Special:Tags, MediaWiki
  will now always use the `change_tag_def` instead of the `change_tag` table.
* MediaWiki now always tidies user output, and most related
  configuration has been removed. Thus $wgUseTidy, $wgTidyBin,
  $wgTidyConf, $wgTidyOpts, $wgTidyInternal, and $wgDebugTidy, all
  deprecated since 1.26, have now all been removed. The $wgTidyConfig
  setting remains only for Remex experimental features or debugging.
* $wgEnableParserCache, deprecated since 1.26, was removed.
  If disabling the parser cache is still desirable,
  set `$wgParserCacheType = CACHE_NONE;` instead.

=== New features in 1.33 ===
* (T96041) __EXPECTUNUSEDCATEGORY__ on a category page causes the category
  to be hidden on Special:UnusedCategories.
* Add PasswordPolicy to check the password isn't in the large blacklist.
* The AuthManagerLoginAuthenticateAudit hook has a new parameter for
  additional information about the authentication event.
* TextContent::getText() was introduced as a replacement for
  Content::getNativeData() for text-based content models.
* (T210814) SVGs are now by default displayed in wiki language on image
  pages.

=== External library changes in 1.33 ===

==== New external libraries ====
* Added wikimedia/password-blacklist 0.1.4.
* Added guzzlehttp/guzzle 6.3.3.

==== Changed external libraries ====
* Updated OOUI from v0.29.2 to v0.30.2.
* Updated OOjs Router from pre-release to v0.2.0.
* Updated wikimedia/xmp-reader from 0.6.0 to 0.6.1.
* Updated wikimedia/scoped-callback from 2.0.0 to 3.0.0.
* Updated wikimedia/ip-set from 1.2.0 to 2.0.0.
  * The deprecated IPSet\IPSet alias was removed, Wikimedia\IPSet must be
    used instead.
* Updated qunitjs from 2.6.2 to 2.9.1.

==== Removed external libraries ====

=== Bug fixes in 1.33 ===
* (T164211) Special:UserRights could sometimes fail with a
  "conflict detected" error when there weren't any conflicts.

=== Action API changes in 1.33 ===
* (T198913) Added 'ApiOptions' hook.
* The JSON formatversion=2 is no longer experimental.
* Internal API errors (those with code beginning "internal_api_error") will
  include the exception class name in a data field named "errorclass".
  * Class names are not guaranteed to remain stable, and in particular database
    exceptions will now include the "Wikimedia\Rdbms\" prefix in the class name.
  * The code including an exception class name is deprecated. In the future,
    all internal errors will use code "internal_api_error".
* (T212356) When using action=delete on pages with many revisions, the module
  may return a boolean-true 'scheduled' and no 'logid'. This signifies that the
  deletion will be processed via the job queue.
* action=setnotificationtimestamp will now update the watchlist asynchronously
  if entirewatchlist is set, so updates may not be visible immediately

=== Action API internal changes in 1.33 ===
* A number of deprecated methods for API documentation, intended for overriding
  by extensions, are no longer called by MediaWiki, and will emit deprecation
  notices if your extension attempts to use them:
  * ApiBase::getDescription() (deprecated in 1.25)
  * ApiBase::getParamDescription() (deprecated in 1.25)
  * ApiBase::getExamples() (deprecated in 1.25)
  * ApiBase::getDescriptionMessage() (deprecated in 1.30)
  Additionally, the  'APIGetDescription' and 'APIGetParamDescription' hooks have
  been removed, as their only use was to let extensions override values returned
  by getDescription() and getParamDescription(), respectively.
* API error codes may only contain ASCII letters, numbers, underscore, and
  hyphen. Methods such as ApiBase::dieWithError() and
  ApiMessageTrait::setApiCode() will throw an InvalidArgumentException if
  passed a bad code.

=== Languages updated in 1.33 ===
MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated regularly.
Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as changes to languages
because of Phabricator reports.

* (T203908) Added language support for Eastern Pwo (kjp).
* (T213717) Fixed a translation error on Goan Konkani (gom-deva) translations
  for NS_TEMPLATE.
* (T212221) Added $digitTransformTable for Santali (sat).

=== Breaking changes in 1.33 ===
* The parameteter $lang in DifferenceEngine::setTextLanguage must be of type
  Language. Other types are deprecated since 1.32.
* Skin::doEditSectionLink requires type Language for the parameter $lang.
  The parameters $tooltip and $lang are mandatory. Omitting the parameters is
  deprecated since 1.32.
* Language::truncate(), deprecated in 1.31, has been removed.
* UtfNormal, deprecated in 1.25, was removed. Use UtfNormal\Validator directly
  instead.
* (T197179) In OOUI HTMLForm fields, the parameters 'notice', 'notice-messages',
  and 'notice-message', which were deprecated in 1.32, were removed. Instead,
  use 'help', 'help-message', and 'help-messages'.
* (T197179) HTMLFormField::getNotices(), deprecated in 1.32, was removed.
* The "Parsoid v1" compatibility mappings in ParsoidVirtualRESTService and
  RestbaseVirtualRESTService, deprecated since 1.26, have been removed.
  Use the RESTBase v1 or Parsoid v3 API instead.
* ParserOptions defaults 'tidy' to true now, since the untidy modes of the
  parser are being deprecated and ParserOptions::getCanonicalOverrides()
  has always been true at any rate.
* Support for disabling tidy and external tidy implementations has been removed.
  This was deprecated in 1.32. The pure PHP Remex tidy implementation is now
  used and no configuration is necessary.
* A number of deprecated methods for API documentation, intended for overriding
  by extensions, are no longer called by MediaWiki, and will emit deprecation
  notices if your extension attempts to use them:
  * ApiBase::getDescription() (deprecated in 1.25)
  * ApiBase::getParamDescription() (deprecated in 1.25)
  * ApiBase::getExamples() (deprecated in 1.25)
  * ApiBase::getDescriptionMessage() (deprecated in 1.30)
  Additionally, the  'APIGetDescription' and 'APIGetParamDescription' hooks have
  been removed, as their only use was to let extensions override values returned
  by getDescription() and getParamDescription(), respectively.
* The authentication hooks 'AbortAutoAccount' 'AbortNewAccount', 'AbortLogin',
  'LoginUserMigrated', 'UserCreateForm', and 'UserLoginForm', all deprecated by
  the creation of AuthManager in 1.27, have been removed. This also means that
  the FakeAuthTemplate and LoginForm classes are removed, that FakeAuthTemplate
  is no longer passed into LoginSignupSpecialPage->getFieldDefinitions(), and
  that LoginSignupSpecialPage->getBCFieldDefinitions() is removed.
* The 'jquery.localize' module, deprecated in 1.32, has been removed. Instead,
  use 'jquery.i18n'.
* The hooks LanguageGetSpecialPageAliases and LanguageGetMagic, deprecated since
  1.16, have now been removed. Instead, use $specialPageAliases or $magicWords
  respectively in a $wgExtensionMessagesFiles file.
* The following methods of the Preferences class, deprecated in 1.31, have been
  removed:
  * getSaveBlacklist()
  * loadPreferenceValues()
  * getOptionFromUser()
  * profilePreferences()
  * skinPreferences()
  * filesPreferences()
  * datetimePreferences()
  * renderingPreferences()
  * editingPreferences()
  * rcPreferences()
  * watchlistPreferences()
  * searchPreferences()
  * miscPreferences()
  * generateSkinOptions()
  * getDateOptions()
  * getImageSizes()
  * getThumbSizes()
  * validateSignature()
  * cleanSignature()
  * getTimezoneOptions()
  * filterIntval()
  * filterTimezoneInput()
  * getTimeZoneList()
* mw.util.jsMessage(), deprecated in 1.20, was removed. Use mw.notify instead.
* (T61113) User::EDIT_TOKEN_SUFFIX was removed. It was deprecated since 1.27.
* The 'mediawiki.api' module aliases, deprecated in 1.32, have been removed.
  Specifically: mediawiki.api.category, mediawiki.api.edit,
  mediawiki.api.login, mediawiki.api.options, mediawiki.api.parse,
  mediawiki.api.upload, mediawiki.api.user, mediawiki.api.watch,
  mediawiki.api.messages, and mediawiki.api.rollback.
* The 'jquery.byteLimit' module alias for 'jquery.lengthLimit',
  deprecated in 1.31, was removed.
* Revision::fetchRevision(), deprecated in 1.28, was removed.
* Class SquidUpdate, deprecated in 1.27, was removed.

=== Deprecations in 1.33 ===
* The configuration option $wgUseESI has been deprecated, and is expected
  to be removed in a future release.
* The configuration option $wgSquidPurgeUseHostHeader has been deprecated,
  and is expected to be removed in a future release.
* The configuration options $wgFixArabicUnicode and $wgFixMalayalamUnicode,
  introduced in MW 1.17, have been deprecated.  These fixes will always be
  applied for Arabic and Malayalam in the future.  Please enable these on
  your local wiki (if you have them explicitly set to false) and run
  maintenance/cleanupTitles.php to fix any existing page titles.
* The LegacyHookPreAuthenticationProvider class, deprecated since its creation
  in 1.27 as part of the AuthManager re-write, now emits deprecation warnings.
  This will help identify the issue if you added it to $wgAuthManagerConfig.
* wfSplitWikiId() is now deprecated. Cache key generation should have the wiki
  domain ID as a key component and use makeGlobalKey().
* (T202094) Title::getUserCaseDBKey() is deprecated; instead, please use
  Title::getDBKey(), which doesn't vary case.
* User::getPasswordValidity() is now deprecated. User::checkPasswordValidity()
  returns the same information in a more useful format.
* For Linker::generateTOC() and Linker::tocList(), passing strings or booleans
  as the $lang parameter was deprecated. The same applies to DummyLinker.
* The PasswordPolicy 'PasswordCannotBePopular' has been deprecated. To
  follow best practices, it is reccommended to use 'PasswordNotInLargeBlacklist'
  instead which blacklists 100,000 commonly used passwords.
* (T208862) Action::requiresUnblock() is now called from
  Title::getUserPermissionsErrors() and Title::userCan(). Previously, the method
  was only called in Action::checkCanExecute(). Actions should ensure that their
  requiresUnblock() returns the proper result (the default is `true`).
* (T211608) The MediaWiki\Services namespace has been renamed to
  Wikimedia\Services. The old name is still supported, but deprecated.
* (T155582) Content::getNativeData has been deprecated. Please use model-
  specific getters, such as TextContent::getText().
* The class WebInstallerOutput is now marked as @private.
* (T209699) The jquery.async module has been deprecated. JavaScript code that
  needs asynchronous behaviour should use Promises.
* Password::equals() is deprecated, use verify().
* BaseTemplate::msgWiki() and QuickTemplate::msgWiki() will be removed. Use
  other means to fetch a properly escaped message string or Message object.
* (T126091) The 'ResourceLoaderTestModules' hook, which lets you declare QUnit
  testing code for your JavaScript modules, is deprecated. Instead, you can now
  use the new extension registration key 'QUnitTestModule'.

=== Other changes in 1.33 ===
* (T208871) The hard-coded Google search form on the database error page was
  removed.
* (T201747) Html::openElement() warns if given an element name with a space
  in it.

== Compatibility ==
MediaWiki 1.33 requires PHP 7.0.0 or later. Although HHVM 3.18.5 or later is
supported, it is generally advised to use PHP 7.0.0 or later for long term
support.

MySQL/MariaDB is the recommended DBMS. PostgreSQL or SQLite can also be used,
but support for them is somewhat less mature. There is experimental support for
Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server.

The supported versions are:

* MySQL 5.5.8 or later
* PostgreSQL 9.2 or later
* SQLite 3.3.7 or later
* Oracle 9.0.1 or later
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 (9.00.1399)

== Upgrading ==
1.33 has several database changes since 1.32, and will not work without schema
updates. Note that due to changes to some very large tables like the revision
table, the schema update may take quite long (minutes on a medium sized site,
many hours on a large site).

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions, including
important information when upgrading from versions prior to 1.11.

For notes on 1.32.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

== Mailing list ==
A mailing list is available for MediaWiki user support and discussion:

       https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-l

A low-traffic announcements-only list is also available:

       https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-announce

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.

== IRC help ==
There's usually someone online in #mediawiki on irc.freenode.net.
