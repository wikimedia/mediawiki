== MediaWiki 1.33 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.33 is an alpha-quality branch and is not recommended for use in
production.

=== Configuration changes in 1.33 ===

==== New configuration ====
* $wgEnablePartialBlocks – This enables the Partial Blocks feature, which gives
  accounts with block permissions the ability to block users, IPs, and IP ranges
  from editing specific pages, while allowing them to edit the rest of the wiki.
* $wgMediaInTargetLanguage – whether multilingual images should be dispalyed in
  the current parse language where available.

==== Changed configuration ====
* Some external link searches will not work correctly until update.php (or
  refreshExternallinksIndex.php) is run. These include searches for links using
  IP addresses, internationalized domain names, and possibly mailto links.
* (T193868) $wgChangeTagsSchemaMigrationStage — This temporary setting, added in
  MediaWiki 1.32, now defaults to MIGRATION_NEW instead of MIGRATION_WRITE_BOTH.
* …

==== Removed configuration ====
* (T199334) $wgTagStatisticsNewTable — This temporary setting, added in
  MediaWiki 1.32, has now been removed. When loading Special:Tags, MediaWiki
  will now always use the `change_tag_def` instead of the `change_tag` table.
* …

=== New features in 1.33 ===
* The 'GetPreferences' hook now receives an additional $context parameter.
* (T96041) __EXPECTUNUSEDCATEGORY__ on a category page causes the category
  to be hidden on Special:UnusedCategories.

=== Bug fixes in 1.33 ===
* …

=== Action API changes in 1.33 ===
* (T198913) Added 'ApiOptions' hook.
* The JSON formatversion=2 is no longer experimental.
* …

=== Action API internal changes in 1.33 ===
* A number of deprecated methods for API documentation, intended for overriding
  by extensions, are no longer called by MediaWiki, and will emit deprecation
  notices if your extension attempts to use them:
  * ApiBase::getDescription() (deprecated in 1.25)
  * ApiBase::getParamDescription() (deprecated in 1.25)
  * ApiBase::getExamples() (deprecated in 1.25)
  * ApiBase::getDescriptionMessage() (deprecated in 1.30)
  Additionally, the  'APIGetDescription' and 'APIGetParamDescription' hooks have
  been removed, as their only use was to let extensions override values returned
  by getDescription() and getParamDescription(), respectively.
* …

=== Languages updated in 1.33 ===
MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated regularly.
Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as changes to languages
because of Phabricator reports.

* (T203908) Added language support for Eastern Pwo (kjp).

=== Breaking changes in 1.33 ===
* The parameteter $lang in DifferenceEngine::setTextLanguage must be of type
  Language. Other types are deprecated since 1.32.
* Skin::doEditSectionLink requires type Language for the parameter $lang.
  The parameters $tooltip and $lang are mandatory. Omitting the parameters is
  deprecated since 1.32.
* Language::truncate(), deprecated in 1.31, has been removed.
* UtfNormal, deprecated in 1.25, was removed. Use UtfNormal\Validator directly
  instead.
* (T197179) In OOUI HTMLForm fields, the parameters 'notice', 'notice-messages',
  and 'notice-message', which were deprecated in 1.32, were removed. Instead,
  use 'help', 'help-message', and 'help-messages'.
* (T197179) HTMLFormField::getNotices(), deprecated in 1.32, was removed.
* The "Parsoid v1" compatibility mappings in ParsoidVirtualRESTService and
  RestbaseVirtualRESTService, deprecated since 1.26, have been removed.
  Use the RESTBase v1 or Parsoid v3 API instead.
* ParserOptions defaults 'tidy' to true now, since the untidy modes of the
  parser are being deprecated and ParserOptions::getCanonicalOverrides()
  has always been true at any rate.
* A number of deprecated methods for API documentation, intended for overriding
  by extensions, are no longer called by MediaWiki, and will emit deprecation
  notices if your extension attempts to use them:
  * ApiBase::getDescription() (deprecated in 1.25)
  * ApiBase::getParamDescription() (deprecated in 1.25)
  * ApiBase::getExamples() (deprecated in 1.25)
  * ApiBase::getDescriptionMessage() (deprecated in 1.30)
  Additionally, the  'APIGetDescription' and 'APIGetParamDescription' hooks have
  been removed, as their only use was to let extensions override values returned
  by getDescription() and getParamDescription(), respectively.
* The authentication hooks 'AbortAutoAccount' 'AbortNewAccount', 'AbortLogin',
  'LoginUserMigrated', 'UserCreateForm', and 'UserLoginForm', all deprecated by
  the creation of AuthManager in 1.27, have been removed. This also means that
  the FakeAuthTemplate and LoginForm classes are removed, that FakeAuthTemplate
  is no longer passed into LoginSignupSpecialPage->getFieldDefinitions(), and
  that LoginSignupSpecialPage->getBCFieldDefinitions() is removed.
* The 'jquery.localize' module, deprecated in 1.32, has been removed. Instead,
  use 'jquery.i18n'.
* The hooks LanguageGetSpecialPageAliases and LanguageGetMagic, deprecated since
  1.16, have now been removed. Instead, use $specialPageAliases or $magicWords
  respectively in a $wgExtensionMessagesFiles file.
* The following methods of the Preferences class, deprecated in 1.31, have been
  removed:
  * getSaveBlacklist()
  * loadPreferenceValues()
  * getOptionFromUser()
  * profilePreferences()
  * skinPreferences()
  * filesPreferences()
  * datetimePreferences()
  * renderingPreferences()
  * editingPreferences()
  * rcPreferences()
  * watchlistPreferences()
  * searchPreferences()
  * miscPreferences()
  * generateSkinOptions()
  * getDateOptions()
  * getImageSizes()
  * getThumbSizes()
  * validateSignature()
  * cleanSignature()
  * getTimezoneOptions()
  * filterIntval()
  * filterTimezoneInput()
  * getTimeZoneList()

=== Deprecations in 1.33 ===
* The configuration option $wgUseESI has been deprecated, and is expected
  to be removed in a future release.
* The configuration option $wgSquidPurgeUseHostHeader has been deprecated,
  and is expected to be removed in a future release.
* The configuration options $wgFixArabicUnicode and $wgFixMalayalamUnicode,
  introduced in MW 1.17, have been deprecated.  These fixes will always be
  applied for Arabic and Malayalam in the future.  Please enable these on
  your local wiki (if you have them explicitly set to false) and run
  maintenance/cleanupTitles.php to fix any existing page titles.
* The LegacyHookPreAuthenticationProvider class, deprecated since its creation
  in 1.27 as part of the AuthManager re-write, now emits deprecation warnings.
  This will help identify the issue if you added it to $wgAuthManagerConfig.
* wfSplitWikiId() is now deprecated. Cache key generation should have the wiki
  domain ID as a key component and use makeGlobalKey().
* …

=== Other changes in 1.33 ===
* (T208871) The hard-coded Google search form on the database error page was
  removed.
* …

== Compatibility ==
MediaWiki 1.33 requires PHP 7.0.0 or later. Although HHVM 3.18.5 or later is
supported, it is generally advised to use PHP 7.0.0 or later for long term
support.

MySQL/MariaDB is the recommended DBMS. PostgreSQL or SQLite can also be used,
but support for them is somewhat less mature. There is experimental support for
Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server.

The supported versions are:

* MySQL 5.5.8 or later
* PostgreSQL 9.2 or later
* SQLite 3.3.7 or later
* Oracle 9.0.1 or later
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 (9.00.1399)

== Upgrading ==
1.33 has several database changes since 1.32, and will not work without schema
updates. Note that due to changes to some very large tables like the revision
table, the schema update may take quite long (minutes on a medium sized site,
many hours on a large site).

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions, including
important information when upgrading from versions prior to 1.11.

For notes on 1.32.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

== Online documentation ==
Documentation for both end-users and site administrators is available on
MediaWiki.org, and is covered under the GNU Free Documentation License (except
for pages that explicitly state that their contents are in the public domain):

       https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Documentation

== Mailing list ==
A mailing list is available for MediaWiki user support and discussion:

       https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-l

A low-traffic announcements-only list is also available:

       https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-announce

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.

== IRC help ==
There's usually someone online in #mediawiki on irc.freenode.net.
