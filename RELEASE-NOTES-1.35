== MediaWiki 1.35.0-PRERELEASE ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.35 is an alpha-quality development branch, and is not recommended
for use in production.

== Upgrading notes for 1.35 ==
1.35 has several database changes since 1.34, and will not work without schema
updates. Note that due to changes to some very large tables like the revision
table, the schema update may take quite long (minutes on a medium sized site,
many hours on a large site).

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions, including
important information when upgrading from versions prior to 1.11.

Some specific notes for MediaWiki 1.35 upgrades are below:

Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as changes to languages
because of Phabricator reports.

* …

=== Breaking changes in 1.35 ===
* ResourceLoader::getLessVars(), deprecated in 1.32, was removed.
  Use ResourceLoaderModule::getLessVars() instead.
* The mediawiki.RegExp module alias, deprecated in 1.34, was removed.
  Use the mediawiki.util module instead.
* The easy-deflate.inflate module, unused since 1.32, was removed.
* The internal variable $constructorOptions for the Parser & SpecialPageFactory,
  exposed only for integration purposes, are now each replaced by a const called
  CONSTRUCTOR_OPTIONS. This was a breaking change made without deprecation.
* ObjectCache::getWANInstance, deprecated in 1.34, was removed.
  Use MediaWikiServices::getMainWANObjectCache instead.
* ObjectCache::newWANCacheFromParams, deprecated in 1.34, was removed.
  Construct WANObjectCache directly instead, or use MediaWikiServices.
* ApiQueryUserInfo::getBlockInfo, deprecated in 1.34, was removed. Use
  ApiBlockInfoTrait::getBlockDetails instead.
* Password::equals(), deprecated in 1.33, was removed. Use Password::verify().
* QuickTemplate::setRef(), deprecated in 1.31, was removed. Use set().
* The mediawiki.ui.text module, deprecated in 1.28 and unused, was removed.
* AbstractBlock::mReason, deprecated in 1.34, is no longer public.
* The GetBlockedStatus, deprecated in 1.34, has been removed. Instead, use the
  GetUserBlock hook.
* …

=== Deprecations in 1.35 ===
* The PHPUnit4And6Compat class, used to provide compatibility with PHPUnit 4, is
  now deprecated. MediaWiki support for PHPUnit 4 ended with the removal of HHVM
  support.
* AbstractBlock::getPermissionsError and AbstractBlock::getBlockErrorParams are
  deprecated. Use BlockErrorFormatter::getMessage instead.
* The following Language methods are deprecated: getFallbackFor,
  getFallbacksFor, getFallbacksIncludingSiteLanguage. Use the corresponding new
  methods on the LanguageFallback class: getFirst, getAll, and
  getAllIncludingSiteLanguage.
* Title::countRevisionsBetween has been deprecated and moved into RevisionStore.
* AbstractBlock::getReason is deprecated, since reasons are actually stored as
  CommentStoreComments, and getReason returns a string with no caller control
  over language or formatting. Instead use AbstractBlock::getReasonComment,
  which returns the CommentStoreComment.
* The global function wfGetRusage() is deprecated and will now always call the
  getrusage() function without checking for its existence.
* The properties User::mBlock, User::mBlockedby and User::mHideName are
  deprecated. Instead, use User::getBlock to get the block, then use
  AbstractBlock::getByName or AbstractBlock::getHideName.Use the GetUserBlock
  hook to set, unset or modify a block, including hiding or unhiding a user.
* Language::factory() and Language::getParentLanguage() are deprecated, and so
  is directly calling the Language constructor. Use the new LanguageFactory
  class instead.
* Language::classFromCode() is deprecated. There is no reason it should be used
  outside the Language class itself.
* Language::clearCaches() is deprecated. Instead, reset services in your test
  framework.
* Language::$mLangObjCache is deprecated and should be removed in 1.35. Use
  MediaWikiServices instead to get a LanguageFactory.
