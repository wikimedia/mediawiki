== MediaWiki 1.35.0-PRERELEASE ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.35 is an alpha-quality development branch, and is not recommended
for use in production.

== Upgrading notes for 1.35 ==
1.35 has several database changes since 1.34, and will not work without schema
updates. Note that due to changes to some very large tables like the revision
table, the schema update may take quite long (minutes on a medium sized site,
many hours on a large site).

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions, including
important information when upgrading from versions prior to 1.11.

Some specific notes for MediaWiki 1.35 upgrades are below:

* …

For notes on 1.34.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

=== Configuration changes for system administrators in 1.35 ===

…

==== New configuration ====
* $wgDiffEngine can be used to specify the difference engine to use, rather
  than choosing the first of $wgExternalDiffEngine, wikidiff2, or php that
  is usable.
* $wgSearchMatchRedirectPreference – This configuration setting controls whether
  users can set a new preference, search-match-redirect, which decides if search
  should redirect them to exact matches is available. By default, this is set to
  false, which maintains the previous behaviour without preference bloat. Change
  your site's default by setting $wgDefaultUserOptions['search-match-redirect'].
* Per-user concurrency in SpecialContributions can now be limited by setting
  $wgPoolCounterConf['SpecialContributions'] appropriately.
* Added new PasswordPolicyCheck: PasswordCannotBeSubstringInUsername.  Similar
  to the existing PasswordCannotMatchUsername check, this check ensures that
  a user's (case-insensitive) password cannot be a part of their username.
  e.g. password = MyPassword, username = ThisUsersPasswordIsMyPassword.
* $wgLogos – This new configuration setting combines the now-deprecated $wgLogo
  and $wgLogoHD settings into a single, associative array. It provides support
  for a new key, 'wordmark', for setting a horizontal wordmark to show next to
  the graphical logo. To do this, set 'wordmark' to an array with 'src' set to
  the path of the wordmark image, and 'width' and 'height' for its dimensions
  in pixels. $wgLogos inherits the existing support provided by its predecessor
  settings: '1x' mapping to the path of the logo as a 135x135px raster image
  (equivalent to $wgLogo), and '1.5x', '2x', and 'svg' operating as before for
  $wgLogoHD. If $wgLogos is unset, $wgLogo and $wgLogoHD values are read for
  temporary backwards compatibility. (T232140)
* $wgWatchlistExpiry — Whether to enable the watchlist expiry feature. The
  database table (watchlist_expiry) for this is created regardless of this
  setting, but all other aspects of the expiry feature are controlled by it.
* $wgWatchlistPurgeRate — Chance of expired watchlist items being purged on any
  page edit. Only has effect if $wgWatchlistExpiry is true.
* $wgImgAuthPath can be used to override the path prefix used when handling
  img_auth.php requests. (T235357)
* $wgAllowedCorsHeaders — list of headers which can be used in a cross-site API
  request.
* …

==== Changed configuration ====
* $wgResourceLoaderMaxage (T235314) - This configuration array controls the
  max-age for HTTP caching through the Cache-Control header. It has uses the
  "versioned" key for urls that do have a version parameter, and the
  "unversioned" key for urls without a version parameter. The sub keys for
  "client" and "server" are no longer supported in MediaWiki 1.35.
* $wgEnableOpenSearchSuggest - This boolean variable is deprecated and no longer
  used. The OpenSearch API is now always enabled.
* $wgAuthManagerConfig and $wgAuthManagerAutoConfig can now use the 'services'
  option in provider specifications.
* The 'URL' parameter to $wgVirtualRestConfig['modules']['parsoid'], previously
  allowed for backwards-compatibility, has been deprecated.  Use 'url' instead.
* The defaults for $wgVirtualRestConfig['modules']['parsoid'] have been
  updated.  If you were relying on the default values, you may need to update
  your configuration.
* Set $wgXmlDumpSchemaVersion to XML_DUMP_SCHEMA_VERSION_11, so dumps use the
  new dump format per default. Consumers of XML dumps should not be affected if
  they ignore any unknown tags they encounter. Also, the format is effectively
  unchanged for revisions that only contain the main slot. The --schema-version
  option can be used with the dumpBackup.php script to set the dump format.
  (T238921)
* $wgParserConf - This configuration is now deprecated.  It has been
  effectively constant since 2008, and is ignored by core code.
  Configure the ParserFactory service in order to customize the Parser used.
* …

==== Removed configuration ====
* $wgSysopEmailBans — This setting, deprecated in 1.34, was removed. To let
  sysops block email access, use $wgGroupPermissions['sysop']['blockemail'].
* $wgDBWindowsAuthentication — This setting had no effect anymore after support
  for SQL Server was removed in 1.34. (T230418)
* $wgProfileOnly — This setting, deprecated in 1.23, was removed. The profiler
  output should instead be configured via $wgProfiler['output'].
* $wgProfileLimit - This setting, deprecated in 1.25, was removed.
  Set $wgProfiler['threshold'] instead.
* $wgDebugTimestamps - This setting was removed. It affected the text output
  produced via $wgDebugComments, if enabled.
* $wgSkipSkin - This setting, deprecated in 1.23, was removed. To disable a
  skin from being shown, use $wgSkipSkins.
* $wgUseSquid, $wgSquidServers, $wgSquidServersNoPurge, and $wgSquidMaxage,
  deprecated in 1.34, have been removed. Use $wgUseCdn, $wgCdnServers,
  $wgCdnServersNoPurge, or $wgCdnMaxAge instead.
* $wgDisableCounters, deprecated in 1.25, was removed. The feature that it
  controlled was already removed in 1.26, but the variable remained existent
  with a value of `false` for backward-compatibility.
* $wgMaxGeneratedPPNodeCount - This setting was removed.  It only affected
  Preprocessor_DOM, which was deprecated in 1.34 and removed in this release.
* $wgFixArabicUnicode and $wgFixMalayalamUnicode, deprecated in 1.33, were
  removed. The fixes are now always enabled for their respective languages.
* $wgAllowTitlesInSVG, unused and deprecated since 1.34, was removed.
* $wgEnablePartialBlocks - This setting, deprecated when it was added in 1.33,
  was removed. Partial blocks are now always enabled.
* $wgLocalInterwiki, deprecated in 1.23 has been removed.
* $wgContentHandlerUseDB — This setting, deprecated in 1.34, is now entirely
  ignored and should no longer be used by extensions. It will be removed as
  soon as no extension relies on it any more.
* $wgMultiContentRevisionSchemaMigrationStage — This setting must no longer
  be set locally. If the migration stage was set to anything other than
  SCHEMA_COMPAT_NEW locally, update.php must be run after removing the setting.
  Usage of the setting in code is deprecated. The setting will be removed
  completely in 1.36.
* …

=== New user-facing features in 1.35 ===
* (T204618) Whitelisted the aria-hidden HTML attribute for all elements in
  wikitext.
* (T13456) Special:EditPage, Special:PageHistory, Special:PageInfo, and
  Special:Purge have been created as shortcuts for each action.
  Special:EditPage/Foo redirects to title=foo&action=edit, with PageHistory,
  PageInfo, and Purge corresponding to action= history, info, and purge
  respectively. When linked to, its subpage is used as the target. Otherwise,
  it displays a basic interface to allow the end user to specify the target
  manually.
* (T139221) The generated table of contents is now a navigation landmark role
  for assistive technologies.
* (T245931) interwiki map API doesn't report foreign language if
  $wgInterwikiMagic=false
* The form at ?action=watch has a new dropdown list to support expiry dates for
  watchlist items (if $wgWatchlistExpiry is true).
* …

=== New developer features in 1.35 ===
* A Docker based local development develpoment environment configuration is
  included (T238224) and DEVELOPERS.md has been added with usage documentation
  and links to further help.
* If CSP is enabled, extensions can now add additional sources using the
  ContentSecurityPolicy::addDefaultSource, ::addStyleSrc and ::addScriptSrc
  methods (e.g. $context->getOutput()->getCSP()->addDefaultSrc( 'example.com' ))
* Extensions can now specify classes and namespaces to be autoloaded by the
  test autoloader, by setting the "TestAutoloadNamespaces" and
  "TestAutoloadClasses" properties in extension.json. (T196090)
* Added getters for OutputPage's robot, index and follow policies;
  getRobotPolicy() returns the entire policy as a string in the form
  <index policy>,<follow policy> while getIndexPolicy() and getFollowPolicy()
  return their respective policies as a string.
* The ResourceLoaderSiteModulePages and ResourceLoaderSiteStylesModulePages
  hooks were added to allow changing which wiki pages these modules contain.
* The SkinFactory now allows skins to be specified as an ObjectFactory spec,
  allowing the construction of skins with services injected.
* ContentHandlerFactory for most ContentHandler static methods. It has been
  added to the constructors for many classes to improve SOLID / GRASP.
* FileDeleteForm's constructor now accepts a user as the second parameter.
  Support for not passing a user has also been hard-deprecated and will be
  removed in 1.36.
* The ParserPreSaveTransformComplete hook was added.
* The BeforeParserFetchTemplateAndTitle hook was added.
* The ResourceLoaderSkinModule class now has a "legacy" feature that loads
  the stylesheets previously part of the "mediawiki.legacy.shared" and
  "mediawiki.legacy.commonPrint" module.
  Those modules are now deprecated and no longer loaded by skins.
  For skins needing to retain these styles, you will need to load these
  styles via a module using the ResourceLoaderSkinModule class.
  See Vector and Monobook for examples.
* ParserOutput now has methods addExtraCSPStyleSrc, addExtraCSPDefaultSrc
  addExtraCSPScriptSrc for parser tags/functions to be able to add sources
  to the Content Security Policy.
* The HtmlCacheUpdater service was added to unify the logic of purging CDN cache
  and HTML file cache to simplify callers and make them more consistent.
* …

* …

=== Bug fixes in 1.35 ===
* …

=== Action API changes in 1.35 ===
* The 'suggest' parameter of action=opensearch has been deprecated.
  The API behaves the same with and without this parameter.
  It was previously used by $wgEnableOpenSearchSuggest to partially
  disable the API if set to false. Specifically, it would deny internal
  frontend requests carrying this parameter, whilst accepting other requests.
* Integer-type parameters are now validated for syntax rather than being
  interpreted in surprising ways. For example, the following will now return a
  badinteger error:
  * "1.9" (formerly interpreted as "1")
  * " 1" (formerly interpreted as "1")
  * "1e1" (formerly interpreted as "1" or "10", depending on the PHP version)
  * "1foobar" (formerly interpreted as "1")
  * "foobar" (formerly intepreted as "0")
  parameters. Ranges should be assumed to be enforced.
* Many user-type parameters now accept a user ID, formatted like "#12345".
* The 'assert' parameter used by all API modules now supports the value 'anon'.
  When specified, the API will return the 'assertanonfailed' error if the user
  is logged in.
* action=edit now supports  the 'baserevid' parameter for edit conflict
  detection, as an alternative to 'basetimestamp'. Note that self-conflicts
  will continue to be ignored if 'basetimestamp' is set, but not if only
  'baserevid' is set.
* A new module was added to change the content model of existing pages.
  Use action=changecontentmodel. Unlike Special:ChangeContentModel, the api
  module does not work for pages that do not already exist.
* If $wgWatchlistExpiry is true, the following API changes are made:
  * action=watch accepts a new 'expiry' parameter analagous to the expiry
    accepted by action=userrights, action=block, etc.
  * action=query&list=watchlistraw returns pages' watchlist expiry dates.
* (T249526) action=login will now return Failed rather than NeedToken on
  session loss.
* …

=== Action API internal changes in 1.35 ===
* The Action API now uses the Wikimedia\ParamValidator library for parameter
  validation, which brings some new features and changes. For the most part
  existing module code should work as it did before, but see subsequent notes
  for changes.
  * The values for all ApiBase PARAM_* constants have changed. Code should have
    been using the constants rather than hard-coding the values.
  * Several ApiBase PARAM_* constants have been deprecated, see the in-class
    documentation for details. Use the equivalent ParamValidator constants
    instead.
  * The value returned for 'upload'-type parameters has changed from
    WebRequestUpload to Psr\Http\Message\UploadedFileInterface.
* Validation of 'user'-type parameters is more flexible. PARAM constants exist
  to specify the type of "user" allowed and to request UserIdentity objects
  rather than name strings. The default is to accept all types (name, IP,
  range, and interwiki) that were formerly accepted.
* Maximum limits are no longer ignored in "internal mode".
* The $paramName to ApiBase::handleParamNormalization() should now include the
  prefix.
* (T245931) meta=siteinfo&siprop=interwikimap no longer reports language or
  extralanglink when $wgInterwikiMagic is false.
* …

=== Languages updated in 1.35 ===
MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated regularly.
Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as changes to languages
because of Phabricator reports.

* The default targets for the ISBN search from Special:BookSources in English
  have been updated for better international suppport. They will now be
  BetterWorldBooks.com, OpenLibrary.org and Worldcat.org.
* (T248299) Added language support for Inari Sami (smn).
* …

=== Breaking changes in 1.35 ===
* MediaWiki now requires PHP 7.2.22 or above, to avoid segfaults (T228346).
* ResourceLoader::getLessVars(), deprecated in 1.32, was removed.
  Use ResourceLoaderModule::getLessVars() instead.
* The jquery.tabIndex module, deprecated in 1.34, has been removed.

  deprecated in 1.34, was removed.
* SiteConfiguration->localVHosts, deprecated in 1.25, was removed.
  Use $wgLocalVirtualHosts instead.
* The $wgContLanguageCode read-only variable was removed.
  It has been a non-configurable copy of $wgLanguageCode since MW 1.8 (2006).
  Use $wgLanguageCode directly instead.
* ApiQueryUserInfo::getBlockInfo, deprecated in 1.34, was removed. Use
  ApiBlockInfoTrait::getBlockDetails instead.
* Password::equals(), deprecated in 1.33, was removed. Use Password::verify().
* QuickTemplate::setRef(), deprecated in 1.31, was removed. Use set().

  This use pattern was deprecated in 1.34.
* MediaWikiTestCase::prepareServices(), deprecated in 1.32, has been removed
* The method ContentHandler::getSlotDiffRendererInternal is replaced with
  ContentHandler::getSlotDiffRendererWithOptions. This breaks consumers which
  call parent::getSlotDiffRendererInternal (no instances of which are known).

  "apc" entry in $wgObjectCaches now refers to APCUBagOStuff.
* Database::bufferResults(), deprecated in 1.34, has been removed.
* CannotReplaceActiveServiceException, ContainerDisabledException,
  DestructibleService, NoSuchServiceException, SalvageableService,

  the MediaWiki\\Services namespace instead.
* The following methods in the Interwiki class were removed: ::fetch(),
  ::isValidInterwiki(), ::invalidateCache(), and ::getAllPrefixes().

  accept arbitrary entries, pass in true for this config.
* OutputPage::parse() and OutputPage::parseInline(), deprecated in 1.32, have
  been removed.  Use ::parseAsContent() or ::parseAsInterface(), as
  appropriate.
* ContentHandler::makeParserOptions(), deprecated in 1.32, was removed. Use

* WikiPage::selectFields, deprecated in 1.31, was removed. Use ::getQueryInfo.
* The remaining static methods for MagicWord, deprecated in 1.32, were removed.
  These were MagicWord::get(), ::getSubstIDs(), ::getDoubleUnderscoreArray(),
  ::getVariableIDs(), and ::getCacheTTL(). Instead, use MagicWordFactory (via
  MediaWikiServices).
* ApiBase::checkTitleUserPermissions no longer accepts a User as the third
  parameter. Passing a user was deprecated in 1.33.
* Sanitizer::setupAttributeWhitelist() and Sanitizer::attributeWhitelist(),

  WikiPage::doEditContent.
* CommentStore::newKey, deprecated in 1.31, was removed.
* Title::isValidMoveOperation, ::moveTo, and ::isValidMoveTarget, deprecated
  in 1.25, were removed. Use the MovePage class and its methods instead.
* Title::getUserCaseDBKey(), deprecated in 1.33, was removed. Use ::getDBkey().
* StringUtils::explodeMarkup() was removed without deprecation.
* AjaxResponse methods that were unused have been removed without deprecation:
  - checkLastModified
  - loadFromMemcached
  - storeInMemcached
  - setCacheDuration
  - setVary
* ApiDelete::delete and ::deleteFile, both of which were protected methods,
  have been made private to allow a signature change.
* HistoryPager::revLink, ::curLink, ::lastLink, and ::diffButtons, which had
  no visibilities defined, have been made private to allow signature changes.
* WikiPage::setLastEdit, which was previously protected, has been made
  private to allow a signature change.
* Skin::getSkinNameMessages() deprecated in 1.34, has been removed.
* Skin::escapeSearchLink() deprecated in 1.34, has been removed, use
  Skin::getSearchLink() instead.
* Revision::loadFromId and RevisionStore::loadRevisionFromId have been
  removed.
* OutputPage::parserOptions doesn't accept an $options parameter anymore.
* MessageCache::getParserOptions previously did not have a visibility set.
  It has been made private.
* The Skin no longer loads the "mediawiki.legacy.shared" or
  "mediawiki.legacy.commonPrint" modules. The legacy shared styles must now
  be loaded by the skin explicitly, either inherited via the
  "mediawiki.skinning.*" modules, or by making your skin's main styles
  module use the ResourceLoaderSkinModule class with the "legacy" attribute.
  See Vector and Monobook for examples.
* Passing an ApiMain to the constructor of ApiResult is no longer supported.
  This was deprecated in 1.25.
* The ArticleAfterFetchContentObject hook, deprecated in 1.32, was removed.
  Use ArticleRevisionViewCustom to control output.
* DatabaseBlock::isValid, deprecated in 1.33, was removed.
* HTMLUserTextField and HTMLUsersMultiselectField previously implied
  required=true when exists=true. Form fields that use exists=true should also
  set required=true if they are required.
* Parser::getDefaultPreprocessorClass(), deprecated in 1.34, has been removed.
* In DatabaseUpdater, the following methods are no longer public: dropTable(),
  modifyTable(), modifyField(), runMaintenance(), copyFile(), appendLine().
  In PostgresUpdater, the following methods are no longer public:
  addPgEnumValue(), addPgIndex(), addPgExtIndex(). This change was made without
  deprecation due to immediate danger of data corruption and loss, see T157651.
  Extensions should instead use dropExtensionTable(),
  modifyExtensionExtensionTable(), modifyExtensionField(), addExtensionUpdate().
  The addExtensionUpdate() method can still be used to access any of the
  protected methods on DatabaseUpdater.
* …

=== Deprecations in 1.35 ===
* The PHPUnit4And6Compat class, used to provide compatibility with PHPUnit 4, is
  now deprecated. MediaWiki support for PHPUnit 4 ended with the removal of HHVM
  support.
* Revision::getRevisionText(), deprecated in 1.32, now emits deprecation alerts.
