== MediaWiki 1.35.0-PRERELEASE ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.35 is an alpha-quality development branch, and is not recommended
for use in production.

== Upgrading notes for 1.35 ==
1.35 has several database changes since 1.34, and will not work without schema
updates. Note that due to changes to some very large tables like the revision
table, the schema update may take quite long (minutes on a medium sized site,
many hours on a large site).

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions, including
important information when upgrading from versions prior to 1.11.

Some specific notes for MediaWiki 1.35 upgrades are below:

* …

For notes on 1.34.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

=== Configuration changes for system administrators in 1.35 ===

…

==== New configuration ====
* $wgDiffEngine can be used to specify the difference engine to use, rather
  than choosing the first of $wgExternalDiffEngine, wikidiff2, or php that
  is usable.
* $wgSearchMatchRedirectPreference – This configuration setting controls whether
  users can set a new preference, search-match-redirect, which decides if search
  should redirect them to exact matches is available. By default, this is set to
  false, which maintains the previous behaviour without preference bloat. Change
  your site's default by setting $wgDefaultUserOptions['search-match-redirect'].
* …

==== Changed configuration ====
* $wgResourceLoaderMaxage (T235314) - This configuration array controls the
  max-age for HTTP caching through the Cache-Control header. It has uses the
  "versioned" key for urls that do have a version parameter, and the
  "unversioned" key for urls without a version parameter. The sub keys for
  "client" and "server" are no longer supported in MediaWiki 1.35.
* …

==== Removed configuration ====
* $wgSysopEmailBans — This setting, deprecated in 1.34, was removed. To let
  sysops block email access, use $wgGroupPermissions['sysop']['blockemail'].
* $wgDBWindowsAuthentication — This setting had no effect anymore after support
  for SQL Server was removed in 1.34. (T230418)

=== New developer features in 1.35 ===

  methods (e.g. $context->getOutput()->getCSP()->addDefaultSrc( 'example.com' ))

=== Breaking changes in 1.35 ===
* ResourceLoader::getLessVars(), deprecated in 1.32, was removed.
  Use ResourceLoaderModule::getLessVars() instead.
* The mediawiki.RegExp module alias, deprecated in 1.34, was removed.
  Use the mediawiki.util module instead.
* The easy-deflate.inflate module, unused since 1.32, was removed.
* The internal variable $constructorOptions for the Parser & SpecialPageFactory,
  exposed only for integration purposes, are now each replaced by a const called
  CONSTRUCTOR_OPTIONS. This was a breaking change made without deprecation.
* ObjectCache::getWANInstance, deprecated in 1.34, was removed.
  Use MediaWikiServices::getMainWANObjectCache instead.
* ObjectCache::newWANCacheFromParams, deprecated in 1.34, was removed.
  Construct WANObjectCache directly instead, or use MediaWikiServices.
* (T231366) The ProfilerOutputDb class and profileinfo.php entry point,
  deprecated in 1.34, was removed.
* ApiQueryUserInfo::getBlockInfo, deprecated in 1.34, was removed. Use
  ApiBlockInfoTrait::getBlockDetails instead.
* Password::equals(), deprecated in 1.33, was removed. Use Password::verify().
* QuickTemplate::setRef(), deprecated in 1.31, was removed. Use set().
* The mediawiki.ui.text module, deprecated in 1.28 and unused, was removed.
* AbstractBlock::mReason, deprecated in 1.34, is no longer public.
* The GetBlockedStatus, deprecated in 1.34, has been removed. Instead, use the
  GetUserBlock hook.
* Parser::disableCache(), deprecated in 1.28, has been removed.
* Parser::serializeHalfParsedText() and the helper functions
  Parser::unserializeHalfParsedText(), Parser::isValidHalfParsedText(),
  StripState::getSubState() and StripState::merge(), deprecated in 1.31, have
  been removed. The helper functions LinkHolderArray::mergeForeign() and
  LinkHolderArray::getSubArray() were also removed.
* Parser::getConverterLanguage(), deprecated in 1.32, was removed. Use
  Parser::getTargetLanguage() instead.
* Parser::getTitle() will throw a TypeError if Parser::$mTitle is
  uninitialized.  This was deprecated in 1.34.
* A number of public methods of Parser were exposed only for
  historical reasons.  They were deprecated in 1.34 and have now been
  made private or removed: doMagicLinks, doDoubleUnderscore,
  doHeadings, doAllQuotes, replaceExternalLinks, replaceInternalLinks,
  replaceInternalLinks2, getVariableValue, initialiseVariables,
  formatHeadings, testPst, testPreprocess, testSrvus,
  areSubpagesAllowed, maybeDoSubpageLink, splitWhitespace,
  createAssocArgs, armorLinks, makeKnownLinkHolder, getImageParams,
  parseLinkParameter, stripAltText, replaceLinkHoldersText.
* …

=== Deprecations in 1.35 ===
* The PHPUnit4And6Compat class, used to provide compatibility with PHPUnit 4, is
  now deprecated. MediaWiki support for PHPUnit 4 ended with the removal of HHVM
  support.
* Revision::getRevisionText(), deprecated in 1.32, now emits deprecation alerts.
* LockManagerGroup::getDefault() and LockManagerGroup::getAny() are deprecated.
  They seem to be unused. Just use get() directly, and catch any exception.
* AbstractBlock::getPermissionsError and AbstractBlock::getBlockErrorParams are
  deprecated. Use BlockErrorFormatter::getMessage instead.
* The following Language methods are deprecated: getFallbackFor,
  getFallbacksFor, getFallbacksIncludingSiteLanguage. Use the corresponding new
  methods on the LanguageFallback class: getFirst, getAll, and
  getAllIncludingSiteLanguage.
* FileJournal::factory is deprecated. Use the constructor directly instead.
* AbstractBlock methods setBlocker(), getBlocker() are deprecated and will
  become internal implementation of DatabaseBlock.
* Title::countRevisionsBetween has been deprecated and moved into RevisionStore.
* FileBackendGroup::singleton() is deprecated. Use MediaWikiServices instead.
* FileBackendGroup::destroySingleton() is deprecated. Test frameworks should
  instead reset MediaWikiServices between test runs.
  (MediaWikiIntegrationTestCase does this automatically.)
* MediaWikiIntegrationTest::setContentLang() has been deprecated. Use
  setMwGlobals( 'wgLanguageCode', 'xxx' ) to set a different site language
  code, or setService( 'ContentLanguage', $myObj ) to set a specific Language
  object. Service resets and $wgContLang will be handled automatically.
* AbstractBlock::getReason is deprecated, since reasons are actually stored as
  CommentStoreComments, and getReason returns a string with no caller control
  over language or formatting. Instead use AbstractBlock::getReasonComment,
  which returns the CommentStoreComment.
* The global function wfGetRusage() is deprecated and will now always call the
  getrusage() function without checking for its existence.
* The properties User::mBlock, User::mBlockedby and User::mHideName are
  deprecated. Instead, use User::getBlock to get the block, then use
  AbstractBlock::getByName or AbstractBlock::getHideName.Use the GetUserBlock
  hook to set, unset or modify a block, including hiding or unhiding a user.
* Language::factory() and Language::getParentLanguage() are deprecated, and so
  is directly calling the Language constructor. Use the new LanguageFactory
  class instead.
* Language::classFromCode() is deprecated. There is no reason it should be used
  outside the Language class itself.
* Language::clearCaches() is deprecated. Instead, reset all services and set
  Language::$mLangObjCache = [].
* Language::$mLangObjCache is deprecated and should be removed in 1.36. Use
  MediaWikiServices instead to get a LanguageFactory.
* Language::getMessagesFor(), getMessageFor(), and getMessageKeysFor() are
  deprecated. Use LocalisationCache's getItem(), getSubitem(), and
  getSubitemList() methods directly.
* OutputPage::getCSPNonce() is deprecated, use OutputPage::getCSP()->getNonce()
  instead.
* Skin::makeI18nUrl() and makeNSUrl() have been deprecated, no longer used.
* Title::countAuthorsBetween and Title::getAuthorsBetween have been deprecated.
  Use respective methods in RevisionStore instead.
