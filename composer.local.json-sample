Create a composer.local.json and add the JSON Code. A sample of the same has been shown below:

    {
        "extra": {
            "merge-plugin": {
                "include": [
                    "extensions/SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi/composer.json"
                ]
            }
        }
    }

Then run `composer update`.
