== MediaWiki 1.27 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.27 is an alpha-quality branch and is not recommended for use in
production.

=== Configuration changes in 1.27 ===
* Removed $wgUseLinkNamespaceDBFields
* Password handling via the User object has been deprecated and partially
  removed, pending the future introduction of AuthManager. In particular:
** expirePassword(), getPasswordExpireDate(), resetPasswordExpiration(), and
   getPasswordExpired() have been removed. They were unused outside of core.
** The mPassword, mNewpassword, mNewpassTime, and mPasswordExpires fields are
   now private and will be removed in the future.
** The getPassword() and getTemporaryPassword() methods now throw
   BadMethodCallException and will be removed in the future.
** The ability to pass 'password' and 'newpassword' to createNew() has been
   removed. The only users of it seem to have been using it to set invalid
   passwords, and so shouldn't be greatly affected.
** setPassword(), setInternalPassword(), and setNewpassword() have been
   deprecated, pending the introduction of AuthManager.
** User::randomPassword() is deprecated in favor of a new method
   PasswordFactory::generateRandomPasswordString()
** User::getPasswordFactory() is deprecated, callers should just create a
   PasswordFactory themselves.
** A new constructor, User::newSystemUser(), has been added to simplify the
   creation of passwordless "system" users for logged actions.

=== New features in 1.27 ===
* User::newSystemUser() may be used to simplify the creation of passwordless
  "system" users for logged actions from scripts and extensions.

==== External libraries ====

=== Bug fixes in 1.27 ===

MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated
regularly. Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as
changes to languages because of Bugzilla reports.


=== Other changes in 1.27 ===


== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.27 requires PHP 5.3.3 or later. There is experimental support for
HHVM 3.3.0.

MySQL is the recommended DBMS. PostgreSQL or SQLite can also be used, but
support for them is somewhat less mature. There is experimental support for
Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server.

The supported versions are:

* MySQL 5.0.3 or later
* PostgreSQL 8.3 or later
* SQLite 3.3.7 or later
* Oracle 9.0.1 or later
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 (9.00.1399)

== Upgrading ==

1.27 has several database changes since 1.26, and will not work without schema
updates. Note that due to changes to some very large tables like the revision
table, the schema update may take quite long (minutes on a medium sized site,
many hours on a large site).

If upgrading from before 1.11, and you are using a wiki as a commons
repository, make sure that it is updated as well. Otherwise, errors may arise
due to database schema changes.

If upgrading from before 1.7, you may want to run refreshLinks.php to ensure
new database fields are filled with data.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, you should upgrade to
1.5 first. The upgrade script maintenance/upgrade1_5.php has been removed
with MediaWiki 1.21.

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.

For notes on 1.26.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

       https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-announce

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.

== IRC help ==
