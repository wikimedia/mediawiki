/**
 * Fixes sister projects box moving down the extract 
 * of the first result (bug #16886).
 * It only happens when the window is small and 
 * This changes slightly the layout for big screens 
 * where there was space for the extracts and the 
 * sister projects and thus it showed like in any 
 * other browser.
 *
 * This will only affect IE 7 and lower
