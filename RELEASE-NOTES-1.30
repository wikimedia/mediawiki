== MediaWiki 1.30 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.30 is an alpha-quality branch and is not recommended for use in
production.

=== MySQL version requirement in 1.30 ===
As of 1.30, MediaWiki now requires MySQL 5.5.8 or higher (see Compatibility
section).

=== Configuration changes in 1.30 ===
* The "C.UTF-8" locale should be used for $wgShellLocale, if available, to avoid
  unexpected behavior when code uses locale-sensitive string comparisons. For
  example, the Scribunto extension considers "bar" < "Foo" in most locales
  since it ignores case.
* $wgShellLocale now affects LC_ALL rather than only LC_CTYPE. See
  documentation of $wgShellLocale for details.
* $wgShellLocale is now applied for all requests. wfInitShellLocale() is
  deprecated and a no-op, as it is no longer needed.
* $wgJobClasses may now specify callback functions as an alternative to plain
  class names. This is intended for extensions that want control over the
  instantiation of their jobs, to allow for proper dependency injection.
* $wgResourceModules may now specify callback functions as an alternative
  to plain class names, using the 'factory' key in the module description
  array. This allows dependency injection to be used for ResourceLoader modules.
* $wgExceptionHooks has been removed.
* (T45547) $wgUsePigLatinVariant added (off by default).

=== New features in 1.30 ===
* (T37247) Output from Parser::parse() will now be wrapped in a div with
  class="mw-parser-output" by default. This may be changed or disabled using
  ParserOptions::setWrapOutputClass().
* Added 'ChangeTagsAllowedAdd' hook, enabling extensions to allow software-
  specific tags to be added by users.
* Added a 'ParserOptionsRegister' hook to allow extensions to register
  additional parser options.
* (T45547) Included Pig Latin, a language game in English, as a
  LanguageConverter variant.  This allows English-speaking developers
  to develop and test LanguageConverter more easily.  Pig Latin can be
  enabled by setting $wgUsePigLatinVariant to true.
* Added RecentChangesPurgeRows hook to allow extensions to purge data that
  depends on the recentchanges table.

=== Languages updated in 1.30 ===

* Support for kbp (Kabɩyɛ / Kabiyè) was added.

=== External library changes in 1.30 ===

==== Upgraded external libraries ====
* mediawiki/mediawiki-codesniffer updated to 0.8.1.

==== New external libraries ====
* The class \TestingAccessWrapper has been moved to the external library
  wikimedia/testing-access-wrapper and renamed \Wikimedia\TestingAccessWrapper.

==== Removed and replaced external libraries ====
* …

=== Bug fixes in 1.30 ===
* (T151633) Ordered list items use now Devanagari digits in Nepalese
  (thanks to Sfic)

=== Action API changes in 1.30 ===
* (T37247) action=parse output will be wrapped in a div with
  class="mw-parser-output" by default. This may be changed or disabled using
  the new 'wrapoutputclass' parameter.
* When errorformat is not 'bc', abort reasons from action=login will be
  formatted as specified by the error formatter parameters.
* action=compare can now handle arbitrary text, deleted revisions, and
  returning users and edit comments.
* (T164106) The 'rvdifftotext', 'rvdifftotextpst', 'rvdiffto',
  'rvexpandtemplates', 'rvgeneratexml', 'rvparse', and 'rvprop=parsetree'
  parameters to prop=revisions are deprecated, as are the similarly named
  parameters to prop=deletedrevisions, list=allrevisions, and
  list=alldeletedrevisions. Use action=compare, action=parse, or
  action=expandtemplates instead.

=== Action API internal changes in 1.30 ===
* ApiBase::getDescriptionMessage() and the "apihelp-*-description" messages are
  deprecated. The existing message should be split between "apihelp-*-summary"
  and "apihelp-*-extended-description".
* (T123931) Individual values of multi-valued parameters can now be marked as
  deprecated.

=== Languages updated in 1.30 ===
MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated
regularly. Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as
changes to languages because of Phabricator reports.

* …

==== Pig Latin added ====
* (T45547) Added Pig Latin, a made-up English variant (en-x-piglatin),
  for easier variant development and testing. Disabled by default. It can be
  enabled by setting $wgUsePigLatinVariant to true.

=== Other changes in 1.30 ===
* The use of an associative array for $wgProxyList, where the IP address is in
  the key instead of the value, is deprecated (e.g. [ '127.0.0.1' => 'value' ]).
  Please convert these arrays to indexed/sequential ones (e.g. [ '127.0.0.1' ]).
* mw.user.bucket (deprecated in 1.23) was removed.
* LoadBalancer::getServerInfo() and LoadBalancer::setServerInfo() are
  deprecated. There are no known callers.
* File::getStreamHeaders() was deprecated.
* MediaHandler::getStreamHeaders() was deprecated.
* Title::canTalk() was deprecated. The new Title::canHaveTalkPage() should be
  used instead.
* MWNamespace::canTalk() was deprecated. The new MWNamespace::hasTalkNamespace()
  should be used instead.
* The ExtractThumbParameters hook (deprecated in 1.21) was removed.
* The OutputPage::addParserOutputNoText and ::getHeadLinks methods (both
  deprecated in 1.24) were removed.
* wfMemcKey() and wfGlobalCacheKey() were deprecated. BagOStuff::makeKey() and
  BagOStuff::makeGlobalKey() should be used instead.
* (T146304) Preprocessor handling of LanguageConverter markup has been improved.
  As a result of the new uniform handling, '-{' may need to be escaped
  (for example, as '-<nowiki/>{') where it occurs inside template arguments
  or wikilinks.
* (T163966) Page moves are now counted as edits for the purposes of
  autopromotion, i.e., they increment the user_editcount field in the database.
* Two new hooks, LogEventsListLineEnding and NewPagesLineEnding, were added for
  manipulating Special:Log and Special:NewPages lines.
* The OldChangesListRecentChangesLine, EnhancedChangesListModifyLineData,
  PageHistoryLineEnding, ContributionsLineEnding and DeletedContributionsLineEnding
  hooks have an additional parameter, for manipulating HTML data attributes of
  RC/history lines. EnhancedChangesListModifyBlockLineData can do that via the
  $data['attribs'] subarray.
* (T130632) The OutputPage::enableTOC() method was removed.
* WikiPage::getParserOutput() will now throw an exception if passed
  ParserOptions that would pollute the parser cache. Callers should use
  WikiPage::makeParserOptions() to create the ParserOptions object and only
  change options that affect the parser cache key.
* Article::viewRedirect() is deprecated.
* DeprecatedGlobal no longer supports passing in a direct value, it requires a
  callable factory function or a class name.
* The $parserMemc global, wfGetParserCacheStorage(), and ParserCache::singleton()
  are all deprecated. The main ParserCache instance should be obtained from
  MediaWikiServices instead. Access to the underlying BagOStuff is possible
  through the new ParserCache::getCacheStorage() method.
* .mw-ui-constructive CSS class (deprecated in 1.27) was removed.

== Compatibility ==
MediaWiki 1.30 requires PHP 5.5.9 or later. There is experimental support for
HHVM 3.6.5 or later.

MySQL/MariaDB is the recommended DBMS. PostgreSQL or SQLite can also be used,
but support for them is somewhat less mature. There is experimental support for
Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server.

The supported versions are:

* MySQL 5.5.8 or later
* PostgreSQL 8.3 or later
* SQLite 3.3.7 or later
* Oracle 9.0.1 or later
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 (9.00.1399)

== Upgrading ==
1.30 has several database changes since 1.29, and will not work without schema
updates. Note that due to changes to some very large tables like the revision
table, the schema update may take a long time (minutes on a medium sized site,
many hours on a large site).

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions, including
important information when upgrading from versions prior to 1.11.

For notes on 1.29.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

== Online documentation ==

A mailing list is available for MediaWiki user support and discussion:

       https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-l

A low-traffic announcements-only list is also available:

       https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-announce

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.

== IRC help ==
There's usually someone online in #mediawiki on irc.freenode.net.
