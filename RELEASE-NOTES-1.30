== MediaWiki 1.30 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.30 is an alpha-quality branch and is not recommended for use in
production.

=== MySQL version requirement in 1.30 ===
As of 1.30, MediaWiki now requires MySQL 5.5.8 or higher (see Compatibility
section).

=== Configuration changes in 1.30 ===
* The "C.UTF-8" locale should be used for $wgShellLocale, if available, to avoid
  unexpected behavior when code uses locale-sensitive string comparisons. For
  example, the Scribunto extension considers "bar" < "Foo" in most locales
  since it ignores case.
* $wgShellLocale now affects LC_ALL rather than only LC_CTYPE. See
  documentation of $wgShellLocale for details.
* $wgShellLocale is now applied for all requests. wfInitShellLocale() is
  deprecated and a no-op, as it is no longer needed.
* $wgJobClasses may now specify callback functions as an alternative to plain
  class names. This is intended for extensions that want control over the
  instantiation of their jobs, to allow for proper dependency injection.
* $wgResourceModules may now specify callback functions as an alternative
  to plain class names, using the 'factory' key in the module description
  array. This allows dependency injection to be used for ResourceLoader modules.
* $wgExceptionHooks has been removed.
* (T163562) $wgRangeContributionsCIDRLimit was introduced to control the size
  of IP ranges that can be queried at Special:Contributions.
* (T45547) $wgUsePigLatinVariant added (off by default).
* (T152540) MediaWiki now supports a section ID escaping style that allows to display
  non-Latin characters verbatim on many modern browsers. This is controlled by the
  new configuration setting, $wgFragmentMode.
* $wgExperimentalHtmlIds is now deprecated and will be removed in a future version,
  use $wgFragmentMode to migrate off it to a modern alternative.
* $wgExternalInterwikiFragmentMode was introduced to control how fragments in
  sinterwikis going outside of current wiki farm are encoded.
* (T120333) Soft-deprecated the use of PHP extension 'mysql' in favor of 'mysqli'.
  This PHP extension was deprecated in PHP 5.5 and removed in PHP 7.0. MediaWiki
  auto-selects the 'mysqli' driver since MediaWiki 1.22, except if explicitly
  requested through the configuration parameter $wgDBservers.
* $wgOOUIEditPage was removed, as it is now the default. This was documented as a
  temporary variable during the migration period.

=== New features in 1.30 ===
* (T37247) Output from Parser::parse() will now be wrapped in a div with
  class="mw-parser-output" by default. This may be changed or disabled using
  ParserOptions::setWrapOutputClass().
* (T163562) Added ability to search for contributions within an IP ranges
  at Special:Contributions.
* Added 'ChangeTagsAllowedAdd' hook, enabling extensions to allow software-
  specific tags to be added by users.
* Added a 'ParserOptionsRegister' hook to allow extensions to register
  additional parser options.
* (T45547) Included Pig Latin, a language game in English, as a
  LanguageConverter variant.  This allows English-speaking developers
  to develop and test LanguageConverter more easily.  Pig Latin can be
  enabled by setting $wgUsePigLatinVariant to true.
* Added RecentChangesPurgeRows hook to allow extensions to purge data that
  depends on the recentchanges table.
* Added JS config values wgDiffOldId/wgDiffNewId to the output of diff pages.
* (T2424) Added direct unwatch links to entries in Special:Watchlist (if the
  'watchlistunwatchlinks' preference option is enabled). With JavaScript
  enabled, these links toggle so the user can also re-watch pages that have
  just been unwatched.
* Added $wgParserTestMediaHandlers, where mock media handlers can be passed to
  MediaHandlerFactory for parser tests.
* Edit summaries, block reasons, and other "comments" are now stored in a
  separate database table. Use the CommentFormatter class to access them.
** This is currently gated by $wgCommentTableSchemaMigrationStage. Most wikis
   can set this to MIGRATION_NEW and run maintenance/migrateComments.php as
   soon as any necessary extensions are updated.
* (T138166) Added ability for users to prohibit other users from sending them
  emails with Special:Emailuser. Can be enabled by setting
  $wgEnableUserEmailBlacklist to true.
* (T67297) $wgBrowserBlacklist is deprecated, and changing it will have no effect.
  Instead, users using browsers that do not support Unicode will be unable to edit
  and should upgrade to a modern browser instead.

  (thanks to Sfic)

=== Action API changes in 1.30 ===
* (T37247) action=parse output will be wrapped in a div with
  class="mw-parser-output" by default. This may be changed or disabled using
  the new 'wrapoutputclass' parameter.

  'rvexpandtemplates', 'rvgeneratexml', 'rvparse', and 'rvprop=parsetree'
  parameters to prop=revisions are deprecated, as are the similarly named
  parameters to prop=deletedrevisions, list=allrevisions, and
  list=alldeletedrevisions. Use action=compare, action=parse, or
  action=expandtemplates instead.

=== Action API internal changes in 1.30 ===
* ApiBase::getDescriptionMessage() and the "apihelp-*-description" messages are
  deprecated. The existing message should be split between "apihelp-*-summary"
  and "apihelp-*-extended-description".
* (T123931) Individual values of multi-valued parameters can now be marked as
  deprecated.

=== Languages updated in 1.30 ===
MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated
regularly. Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as

* Removed: tokipona (Toki Pona)

==== Pig Latin added ====
* (T45547) Added Pig Latin, a made-up English variant (en-x-piglatin),
  for easier variant development and testing. Disabled by default. It can be
  enabled by setting $wgUsePigLatinVariant to true.

=== Other changes in 1.30 ===
* The use of an associative array for $wgProxyList, where the IP address is in
  the key instead of the value, is deprecated (e.g. [ '127.0.0.1' => 'value' ]).
  Please convert these arrays to indexed/sequential ones (e.g. [ '127.0.0.1' ]).
* mw.user.bucket (deprecated in 1.23) was removed.
* LoadBalancer::getServerInfo() and LoadBalancer::setServerInfo() are
  deprecated. There are no known callers.
* File::getStreamHeaders() was deprecated.
* MediaHandler::getStreamHeaders() was deprecated.
* Title::canTalk() was deprecated. The new Title::canHaveTalkPage() should be
  used instead.

  should be used instead.
* The ExtractThumbParameters hook (deprecated in 1.21) was removed.
* The OutputPage::addParserOutputNoText and ::getHeadLinks methods (both
  deprecated in 1.24) were removed.
* wfMemcKey() and wfGlobalCacheKey() were deprecated. BagOStuff::makeKey() and
  BagOStuff::makeGlobalKey() should be used instead.
* (T146304) Preprocessor handling of LanguageConverter markup has been improved.
  As a result of the new uniform handling, '-{' may need to be escaped
  (for example, as '-<nowiki/>{') where it occurs inside template arguments
  or wikilinks.
* (T163966) Page moves are now counted as edits for the purposes of
  autopromotion, i.e., they increment the user_editcount field in the database.
* Two new hooks, LogEventsListLineEnding and NewPagesLineEnding, were added for
  manipulating Special:Log and Special:NewPages lines.
* The OldChangesListRecentChangesLine, EnhancedChangesListModifyLineData,
  PageHistoryLineEnding, ContributionsLineEnding and DeletedContributionsLineEnding
  hooks have an additional parameter, for manipulating HTML data attributes of
  RC/history lines. EnhancedChangesListModifyBlockLineData can do that via the
  $data['attribs'] subarray.
* (T130632) The OutputPage::enableTOC() method was removed.
* WikiPage::getParserOutput() will now throw an exception if passed
  ParserOptions that would pollute the parser cache. Callers should use
  WikiPage::makeParserOptions() to create the ParserOptions object and only
  change options that affect the parser cache key.
* Article::viewRedirect() is deprecated.
* IP::isValidBlock() was deprecated. Use the equivalent IP::isValidRange().
* DeprecatedGlobal no longer supports passing in a direct value, it requires a
  callable factory function or a class name.

  are all deprecated. The main ParserCache instance should be obtained from
  MediaWikiServices instead. Access to the underlying BagOStuff is possible
  through the new ParserCache::getCacheStorage() method.

* Sanitizer::escapeId() was deprecated, use escapeIdForAttribute(),
  escapeIdForLink() or escapeIdForExternalInterwiki() instead.

  Sanitizer functions or, if possible, Title::getFragmentForURL().
* Second parameter to Sanitizer::escapeIdReferenceList() ($options) now does
  nothing and is deprecated.
* mw.util.escapeId() was deprecated, use escapeIdForAttribute() or
  escapeIdForLink().
* MagicWord::replaceMultiple() (deprecated in 1.25) was removed.
* WikiImporter now requires the second parameter to be an instance of the Config,
  class. Prior to that, the Config parameter was optional (a behavior deprecated in
  1.25).
* Removed 'jquery.mwExtension' module. (deprecated since 1.26)
* mediawiki.ui: Deprecate greys, which are not part of WikimediaUI color palette
  any more.

    use ::getSummaryInputWidget() instead.
  * EditPage::getCheckboxes() and ::getCheckboxesOOUI() are deprecated. Please
    use ::getCheckboxesWidget() instead.
  * Creating an EditPage instance without calling EditPage::setContextTitle() should
    be avoided and will be deprecated in a future release.
  * EditPage::safeUnicodeInput() and ::safeUnicodeOutput() are deprecated and no-ops.
  * EditPage::$isCssJsSubpage, ::$isCssSubpage, and ::$isJsSubpage are deprecated. The
    corresponding methods from Title should be used instead.
  * EditPage::$isWrongCaseCssJsPage is deprecated. There is no replacement.
  * EditPage::$mArticle and ::$mTitle are deprecated for public usage. The getters
    ::getArticle() and ::getTitle() should be used instead.
  * Trying to control or fake EditPage context by overriding $wgUser, $wgRequest, $wgOut,
    and $wgLang is no longer supported and won't work. The IContextSource returned from
    EditPage::getContext() must be modified instead.
* Parser::getRandomString() (deprecated in 1.26) was removed.
* Parser::uniqPrefix() (deprecated in 1.26) was removed.
* Parser::extractTagsAndParams() now only accepts three arguments. The fourth,
  $uniq_prefix was deprecated in 1.26 and has now been removed.
* (T172514) The following tables have had their UNIQUE indexes turned into proper
  PRIMARY KEYs for increased maintainability: categorylinks, imagelinks, iwlinks,
  langlinks, log_search, module_deps, objectcache, pagelinks, query_cache, site_stats,
  templatelinks, text, transcache, user_former_groups, user_properties.

  page_restrictions.pr_user, tag_summary.ts_log_id, tag_summary.ts_rev_id and
  user_properties.up_user have all been made unsigned on MySQL.
* DB_SLAVE is deprecated. DB_REPLICA should be used instead.
* wfUsePHP() is deprecated.
* wfFixSessionID() was removed.
* wfShellExec() and related functions are deprecated, use Shell::command(). This also
  slightly changes the behavior of how execution time limits are calculated when only
  some of defaults are overridden per-call. When in doubt, always override both wall
  clock and CPU time.
* (T138166) SpecialEmailUser::getTarget() now requires a second argument, the sending
  user object. Using the method without the second argument is deprecated.
* (T67297) Browsers that don't support Unicode will have their edits rejected.
* (T178450) The module 'jquery.badge' is deprecated and will be removed in a future
  release. For notifying the user of an event, the Notifications ("Echo") system
  should be used instead.

== Compatibility ==
MediaWiki 1.30 requires PHP 5.5.9 or later. There is experimental support for
HHVM 3.6.5 or later.

MySQL/MariaDB is the recommended DBMS. PostgreSQL or SQLite can also be used,
but support for them is somewhat less mature. There is experimental support for
Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server.

The supported versions are:

* MySQL 5.5.8 or later
* PostgreSQL 8.3 or later
* SQLite 3.3.7 or later
* Oracle 9.0.1 or later
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 (9.00.1399)

== Upgrading ==
1.30 has several database changes since 1.29, and will not work without schema
updates. Note that due to changes to some very large tables like the revision
table, the schema update may take a long time (minutes on a medium sized site,
many hours on a large site).

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions, including
important information when upgrading from versions prior to 1.11.

For notes on 1.29.x and older releases, see HISTORY.
