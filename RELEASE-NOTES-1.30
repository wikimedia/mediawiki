== MediaWiki 1.30 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.30 is an alpha-quality branch and is not recommended for use in
production.

=== Configuration changes in 1.30 ===
* The C.UTF-8 locale should be used for $wgShellLocale, if available, to avoid
  unexpected behavior when things use local-sensitive string comparisons. For
  example, Scribunto considers "bar" < "Foo" in most locales since it ignores
  case.
* $wgShellLocale now affects LC_ALL rather than only LC_CTYPE. See
  documentation of $wgShellLocale for details.
* $wgJobClasses may now specify callback functions
  as an alternative to plain class names.
  This is intended for extensions that want control
  over the instantiation of their jobs,
  to allow for proper dependency injection.
* $wgResourceModules may now specify callback functions as an alternative
  to plain class names, using the 'factory' key in the module description
  array. This allows dependency injection to be used for ResourceLoader modules.
* $wgExceptionHooks has been removed.
* $wgShellLocale is now applied for all requests. wfInitShellLocale() is
  deprecated and a no-op, as it is no longer needed.
* WikiPage::getParserOutput() will now throw an exception if passed
  ParserOptions would pollute the parser cache. Callers should use
  WikiPage::makeParserOptions() to create the ParserOptions object and only
  change options that affect the parser cache key.

=== New features in 1.30 ===
* (T37247) Output from Parser::parse() will now be wrapped in a div with
  class="mw-parser-output" by default. This may be changed or disabled using
  ParserOptions::setWrapOutputClass().
* Added 'ChangeTagsAllowedAdd' hook, enabling extensions to allow software-
  specific tags to be added by users.
* Added a 'ParserOptionsRegister' hook to allow extensions to register
  additional parser options.

=== Languages updated in 1.30 ===

* Support for kbp (Kabɩyɛ / Kabiyè) was added.

=== External library changes in 1.30 ===

==== Upgraded external libraries ====
* …

==== New external libraries ====
* The class \TestingAccessWrapper has been moved to the external library
  wikimedia/testing-access-wrapper and renamed \Wikimedia\TestingAccessWrapper.

==== Removed and replaced external libraries ====
* …

=== Bug fixes in 1.30 ===
* (T151633) Ordered list items use now Devanagari digits in Nepalese
  (thanks to Sfic)

=== Action API changes in 1.30 ===
* (T37247) action=parse output will be wrapped in a div with
  class="mw-parser-output" by default. This may be changed or disabled using
  the new 'wrapoutputclass' parameter.
* When errorformat is not 'bc', abort reasons from action=login will be
  formatted as specified by the error formatter parameters.
* action=compare can now handle arbitrary text, deleted revisions, and
  returning users and edit comments.

=== Action API internal changes in 1.30 ===
* …

=== Languages updated in 1.30 ===
MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated
regularly. Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as
changes to languages because of Phabricator reports.

* …

=== Other changes in 1.30 ===
* The use of an associative array for $wgProxyList, where the IP address is in
  the key instead of the value, is deprecated (e.g. [ '127.0.0.1' => 'value' ]).
  Please convert these arrays to indexed/sequential ones (e.g. [ '127.0.0.1' ]).
* mw.user.bucket (deprecated in 1.23) was removed.
* LoadBalancer::getServerInfo() and LoadBalancer::setServerInfo() are
  deprecated. There are no known callers.
* File::getStreamHeaders() was deprecated.
* MediaHandler::getStreamHeaders() was deprecated.
* The ExtractThumbParameters hook (deprecated in 1.21) was removed.
* The OutputPage::addParserOutputNoText and ::getHeadLinks methods (both
  deprecated in 1.24) were removed.
* wfMemcKey() and wfGlobalCacheKey() were deprecated. BagOStuff::makeKey() and
  BagOStuff::makeGlobalKey() should be used instead.
* (T146304) Preprocessor handling of LanguageConverter markup has been improved.
  As a result of the new uniform handling, '-{' may need to be escaped
  (for example, as '-<nowiki/>{') where it occurs inside template arguments
  or wikilinks.
* (T163966) Page moves are now counted as edits for the purposes of
  autopromotion, i.e., they increment the user_editcount field in the database.
* (T130632) The OutputPage::enableTOC() method was removed.

== Compatibility ==
MediaWiki 1.30 requires PHP 5.5.9 or later. There is experimental support for
HHVM 3.6.5 or later.

MySQL/MariaDB is the recommended DBMS. PostgreSQL or SQLite can also be used,
but support for them is somewhat less mature. There is experimental support for
Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server.

The supported versions are:

* MySQL 5.0.3 or later
* PostgreSQL 8.3 or later
* SQLite 3.3.7 or later
* Oracle 9.0.1 or later
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 (9.00.1399)

== Upgrading ==
1.30 has several database changes since 1.29, and will not work without schema
updates. Note that due to changes to some very large tables like the revision
table, the schema update may take quite long (minutes on a medium sized site,
many hours on a large site).

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions, including
important information when upgrading from versions prior to 1.11.

For notes on 1.29.x and older releases, see HISTORY.
