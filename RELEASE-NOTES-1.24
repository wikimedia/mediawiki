have it on, turn it '''off''' if you can.

== MediaWiki 1.24 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.24 is an alpha-quality branch and is not recommended for use in
production.

=== Configuration changes in 1.24 ===
* The server's canonical hostname is available as $wgServerName, which is
  exposed in both mw.config and ApiQuerySiteInfo.
* Introduced $wgPagePropsHaveSortkey as a backwards-compatibility switch,
  for using the old schema of the page_props table, in case the respective
  schema update was not applied.
* $wgSearchEverythingOnlyLoggedIn was removed as the 'searcheverything'
  user option was removed. Use $wgNamespacesToBeSearchedDefault instead or
  if you used to have $wgDefaultUserOptions['searcheverything'] = 1.
* $wgMasterWaitTimeout has been deprecated.
* $wgDBClusterTimeout has been removed.
* $wgProxyKey has been removed. It is no longer used by MediaWiki core.
  Ensure $wgSecretKey is set in LocalSettings.php.
* $wgExtraInterlanguageLinkPrefixes is a new configuration variable that
  contains an array of interwiki prefixes that should be treated as language
  prefixes (i.e. turned into interlanguage links when $wgInterwikiMagic is set
  to true).
* $wgParserTestRemote has been removed.

=== New features in 1.24 ===
* Added a new hook, "WhatLinksHereProps", to allow extensions to annotate
  WhatLinksHere entries.
* Added a new hook, "ContentGetParserOutput", to customize parser output for
  a given content object.
* Deprecated the hook "ShowRawCssJs", use "ContentGetParserOutput" instead.
* HTMLForm's HTMLTextField now supports the 'url' type.
* HTMLForm fields may now be dynamically hidden based on the values of other
  fields in the form.
* HTMLForm now supports multiple copies of an input field or set of input
  fields, e.g. the form may request "one or more usernames" without having to
  have the user enter delimited list of names into a text field.
* Added a new hook, "SidebarBeforeOutput", to allow to edit the structure of
  the sidebar just before its display.
* (bug 49156) Added the mediawiki.cookie ResourceLoader module, which wraps
  jquery.cookie so that getting/setting a cookie is syntactically and
  functionally similar to using the WebRequest::getCookie() and
  WebResponse::setcookie() methods.
* (bug 44740) jQuery upgraded from 1.8.3 to 1.11.1. A new configuration option,
  $wgIncludejQueryMigrate, also loads the jQuery Migrate hack to let extensions
  and gadgets use the long-deprecated functions that were removed in jQuery 1.9.
  This option is turned off by default, and will be removed in MediaWiki 1.25.
* (bug 47076) jQuery UI upgraded from 1.8.24 to 1.9.2.
* Changes to content typography (fonts, etc.). See
  https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Typography_refresh for further information.
* WikitextContent will now render redirects with the expected "redirect"
  header, rather than as an ordered list. Code calling Article::viewRedirect
  can probably be changed to no longer special-case redirects.
* Header font set to a serif font stack. See
  https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Typography_refresh for further information.
* (bug 65567) Added a new hook, "BeforeHttpsRedirect", to allow cancellation of
  the HTTP to HTTPS redirect due to forceHTTPS cookie, userRequires, etc. This
  is only for page views, since this hook doesn't affect UserLogin, OAuth,
  CentralAuth, etc. ATTENTION: This hook is likely to be removed soon due to
  overall design of the system.
* (bug 17367) It is now possible to add pages to your watchlist from
  Special:UnwatchedPages without reloading the special page.
* New methods setVolatile and isVolatile are added to PPFrame, so that
  extensions such as Cite.php can mark that their output is volatile and
  shouldn't be cached.
* (bug 52817) Advanced search options are now saved on the search page itself,
  rather than in a dedicated pane in the preferences panel.
* (bug 44591) The dropdown actions menu (little triangle next to page tabs) in
  the Vector skin has gained a label that should make it more discoverable.
* MWCryptHKDF added for fast, cryptographically secure random number generation
  that won't deplete openssl's entropy pool.
* ResourceLoader: File modules can now provide a skip function that uses an
  inline feature test to bypass loading of the module.
* (bug 20210) Special pages may now provide autocompletion of their subpage
  names in search suggestions. Right now the only useful implementation is in
  Special:Log, but more are to come.
* Special:MostLinkedTemplates is no longer limited to transclusions from the
  Template namespace.
* Skins can now use 'remoteSkinPath' when defining ResourceLoader modules.
  This works the same as 'remoteExtPath' but is relative to the skins/ folder
  instead of the extensions/ folder.
* Added the json2.js polyfill for the ES5 JSON.stringify and JSON.parse methods.
  Exposed as module "json" with a skip function to optimise loading.
* Extensions and skins may now use 'namemsg' in $wgExtensionCredits in addition
  to 'name', to allow for the name to be localizable. 'name' should still be
  specified for backwards-compatibility and to define the path Special:Version
  uses to find extension license information.
* Browser tests are now included to verify basic wiki functionality in developer
  environments. For details on running tests, see tests/browser/README.mediawiki.

=== Bug fixes in 1.24 ===
* (bug 49116) Footer copyright notice is now always displayed in user language
  rather than content language (same as copyright notice for editing interface).
* (bug 62258) A bug was fixed in File::getUnscaledThumb when a height
  restriction was present in the parameters. Images with both the "frame"
  option and a size specification set will now always ignore the provided
  size and display an unscaled image, as the documentation has always
  claimed it would.
* (bug 39035) Improved Vector skin performance by removing collapsibleNav,
  which used to collapse some sidebar elements by default.
  This removes -list id suffixes like p-lang-list: instead of using things like
  #p-lang-list, you can do #p-lang .body ul.
* (bug 890) Links in Special:RecentChanges and Special:Watchlist no longer
  follow redirects to their target pages.
* Parser now dies early if called recursively, instead of producing subtle bugs.
* (bug 14323) Redirect pages, when viewed with redirect=no, no longer hide the
  remaining page content.
* (bug 52587) Maintenance script deleteBatch.php no longer follows redirects
  in the file namespace and delete the file on the target page. It will still
  however delete the redirect page.
* (bug 22683) {{msgnw:}} and other uses of PPFrame::RECOVER_ORIG will correctly
  recover the original code of extension tags.

=== Web API changes in 1.24 ===
* action=parse API now supports prop=modules, which provides the list of
  ResourceLoader modules that should be used to enhance the parsed content.
* action=query&meta=siteinfo&siprop=interwikimap returns a new "protorel"
  field which is true iff protocol-relative urls can be used to access
  a particular interwiki map entry.
* ApiQueryLogEvents now provides logpage, which is the page ID from the
  logging table, if ids are requested and the user has the permissions.
* action=edit now requires that appendtext, prependtext, or section=new be used
  when using the 'redirect' parameter, to prevent clients accidentally
  overwriting the target page with the content of the redirect.
* action=logevents will now return an error if both letitle and leprefix are
  specified.
* action=logevents has a new parameter, lenamespace, to allow filtering by
  namespace.
* action=expandtemplates has a new parameter, prop, and a new output format.
  The old format is still used if prop isn't provided, but this is deprecated.
* meta=userinfo can now return the count of unread pages on the watchlist.
* list=watchlist can now filter by unread status.

=== Languages updated in 1.24 ===

MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated
regularly. Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as
changes to languages because of Bugzilla reports.

=== Other changes in 1.24 ===
* The deprecated jquery.delayedBind ResourceLoader module was removed.
* The deprecated function mw.util.toggleToc was removed.
* The Special:Search hooks SpecialSearchGo and SpecialSearchResultsAppend
  were removed as they were unused.
* (bug 65477) User::pingLimiter() now has an additional profile point varying
  by action being used.
* mediawiki.util.$content no longer supports old versions of the Vector,
  Monobook, Modern and CologneBlue skins that don't yet implement the "mw-body"
  and/or "mw-body-primary" class name in their html.
* Added pp_sortkey column to page_props table, so pages can be efficiently
  queried and sorted by property value (bug 58032).
  See $wgPagePropsHaveSortkey if you want to postpone the schema change.
* BREAKING CHANGE: The Modern and Cologne Blue skins were moved out of MediaWiki
  core to their own respective repositories. See also
  https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Skin:Modern and
  https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Skin:CologneBlue.
* BREAKING CHANGE: Skins built for MediaWiki 1.15 and earlier that do not use
  the "headelement" template key are no longer supported. Setting
  $useHeadElement = false; is no longer supported and will not cause old keys
  like "headlinks", "skinnameclass", etc. to be defined.
* The deprecated 'SpecialVersionExtensionTypes' hook was removed.
* (bug 63891) Add 'X-Robots-Tag: noindex' header in action=render pages.
* SpecialPage no longer supports the syntax for invoking wfSpecial*() functions.
  Special pages should subclass SpecialPage and implement the execute() method.
* (bug 63755) The deprecated constants RC_MOVE and RC_MOVE_OVER_REDIRECT were
  removed.
* Special:MostLinkedTemplates has been renamed to Special:MostTranscludedPages.
* The skin autodiscovery mechanism has been deprecated and will be removed in
  MediaWiki 1.25. See https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Skin_autodiscovery
  for migration guide for creators and users of custom skins that relied on it.
* ResourceLoaderFileModule#getAllStyleFiles now returns all style files and all
  skin style files used by the module.
* Removed getLang() from IContextSource and subclasses. (deprecated since 1.19)
* Removed setLang() from subclasses of IContextSource. (deprecated since 1.19)
* Removed WebRequest::escapeAppendQuery(). (deprecated since 1.20)
* Removed info(), purge(), revert() and rollback() from the Article class; they
  have since become subclasses of the Action class. (deprecated since 1.19)
* SearchEngineReplacePrefixesComplete hook was removed.
* The "jquery.json" module has been deprecated. Use the "json" module instead.
* Removed HTMLForm::addJS(). (deprecated since 1.18)
* Removed LogEventsList::showHeader(). (deprecated since 1.19)
* Removed ImageGalleryBase::useSkin(). (deprecated since 1.18)

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.24 requires PHP 5.3.2 or later.

MySQL is the recommended DBMS. PostgreSQL or SQLite can also be used, but
support for them is somewhat less mature. There is experimental support for
Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server.

The supported versions are:

* MySQL 5.0.2 or later
* PostgreSQL 8.3 or later
* SQLite 3.3.7 or later
* Oracle 9.0.1 or later
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 (9.00.1399)

== Upgrading ==

1.24 has several database changes since 1.23, and will not work without schema
updates. Note that due to changes to some very large tables like the revision
table, the schema update may take quite long (minutes on a medium sized site,
many hours on a large site).

If upgrading from before 1.11, and you are using a wiki as a commons
repository, make sure that it is updated as well. Otherwise, errors may arise
due to database schema changes.

If upgrading from before 1.7, you may want to run refreshLinks.php to ensure
new database fields are filled with data.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, you should upgrade to
1.5 first. The upgrade script maintenance/upgrade1_5.php has been removed
with MediaWiki 1.21.

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.

For notes on 1.23.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

== Online documentation ==

Documentation for both end-users and site administrators is available on
MediaWiki.org, and is covered under the GNU Free Documentation License (except
for pages that explicitly state that their contents are in the public domain):

	https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Documentation

== Mailing list ==

A mailing list is available for MediaWiki user support and discussion:

	https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-l

A low-traffic announcements-only list is also available:

	https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-announce

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.

== IRC help ==

There's usually someone online in #mediawiki on irc.freenode.net.
