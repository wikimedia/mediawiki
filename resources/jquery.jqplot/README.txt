the distribution.  To use jqPlot include jQuery, the jqPlot jQuery plugin, the jqPlot css file and 
optionally the excanvas script to support IE version prior to IE 9 in your web page:

> <!--[if lt IE 9]><script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="excanvas.js"></script><![endif]-->
> <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="jquery-1.4.4.min.js"></script>
> <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="jquery.jqplot.min.js"></script>
> <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="jquery.jqplot.css" />

For usage instructions, see <jqPlot Usage> in usage.txt.  For available options, see
<jqPlot Options> in jqPlotOptions.txt.

Building from source:

If you've cloned the repository, you can build a distribution from source.
You need to have ant <http://ant.apache.org> installed.  You can simply 
type "ant" from the jqplot directory to build the default "all" target.  
There are 6 pertinent targets: clean, dist, min, docs, compress and all.  Use:

> ant -p

to get a description of the various build targets.
