/*
Buttons

All buttons start with mw-ui-button class, modified by other classes.
It can be any element.  Due to a lack of a CSS reset, the exact styling of
the button depends on what type of element is used.
There are two kinds of buttons, the default is a "Call to Action" with an obvious border
and there is a quiet kind without a border.
