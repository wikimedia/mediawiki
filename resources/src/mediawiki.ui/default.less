Inputs

When using an input or textarea apply the mw-ui-input class.

/*
Buttons

Buttons begin with a single mw-ui-button class, and then can be adjusted using context and modifier classes.
Buttons are explicitly restricted to BUTTON, INPUT, and A tags. To use these in any other context, you'll have to use
the .mw-ui-button-mixin() mixin in your own LESS file on your own selector, but this is not recommended and goes against
the Style Guide.
