##Design Philosophy

###Inviting
Our aesthetics should be clean and encourage interaction.

###Worldly
We are thoughtful and are aware of cultural differences. We are careful about words, color usage, and images that might offend. We are also aware of limited connectivity in some areas of the world and are thoughtful of image sizes and loading speed.  We work to support accessibility.
