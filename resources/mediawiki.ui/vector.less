// Typography
//
// We prefer the usage of Georgia Bold for all headings. Georgia Regular is used to place emphasis on pull-out or short quotations. This latter usage should be used sparingly. 
//
// We prefer the use of Helvetica Neue Regular for body copy. Helvetiva Neue Bold for sub-headers. Pull-out quotes within the body copy should use Helvetica Neue Bold. Helvetica Neue is an not open-source font. Hence, below is a list of preferred alternate choices.
//
// Second choice: Helvetica
//
// Third choice: Arial
//
// Our content is predominantly text, hence visual hierarchy must be clear. Use these recommended type sizes to inform and establish information hierarchy and organization. 
//
// Unless if you plan to put extra attention and manually adjust spacing, avoid justifying texts and paragraphs as they are harder to read and create unnecessary visual distractions. Along with centered text, they convey a formal and less friendly environment. 
//
// It will be important to talk about other languages, scripts and writing direction - with the same level as importance, not as an afterthought.
