Change notes from older releases. For current info see RELEASE-NOTES.

Security reminder: MediaWiki does not require PHP's register_globals

== Version 1.3.5, 2004-09-30 ==

Changes from 1.3.4:
* Clean up input validation in 'raw' page output mode which was a potential
  cross-site scripting opportunity.


== Version 1.3.4, 2004-09-28 ==

************************** SECURITY NOTE! ******************************

As of 1.3.4, MediaWiki performs some screening of newly uploaded files for
validity. (Some)  corrupt image files, and HTML files mistakenly or
maliciously masquerading as images, should now be rejected.

These checks protect against Internet Explorer security holes relating
to type autodetection which are a potential cross-site scripting attack
vector, and also rejects at least one known version of the "JPEG virus"
which might attack unpatched clients.

If you already have invalid files uploaded this will not protect against
them. If you have expanded the filetype whitelist or disabled the strict
type checking, other dangerous file types may still get through. You should
always be careful when allowing uploads!


Changes from 1.3.3:
* Fixed lots of template-related bugs, esp. for cases where template
  variables are used for links, images, etc.
* Fixed transformation of page messages when viewing Special:Allmessages
* Handle "ISBN ISBN 1234" correctly
* Fixed warning on Category pages
* Fixed some bad error messages on login page
* Fixed history entry for initial main page on install
* Removed problematic { and } from legal title characters
* Strip leading blank from output in preformated text.
* Fixed problem when moving pages to titles with '#' in
* Optional $wgRawHtml for raw <html> sections. Use only on limited-
  participation 'trusted' wikis, as it does not protect against cross-site
  scripting attacks. For security, this option can only be enabled if in
  $wgWhitelistEdit mode.
* Fixed problem where pages which were created as a redirect following
  a move never showed on Special:Randompage.
* Fixed line spacing on printed table of contents
* Allow links to pages with names of the form [[RFC 1234]]
* Fixed broken edit links being shown for sections from included templates
* Verify that uploaded image files are of the claimed type.


== Version 1.3.3, 2004-09-09 ==

Changes from 1.3.2:
* Fix for long numeric page titles
* Fix Go search for "0", numeric almost-self-links
* Avoid caching of pages with "You have new messages" headers
* Fix for upgrades as non-root users from 1.2 command-line installs.
* Fix for $wgDebugDumpSql debug mode.
* $wgExtraNamespaces setting for configuring additional namespaces
  (see note in DefaultSettings.php)
* 'recache' on query pages now disabled when miser mode is on; special case the
  global settings in your LocalSettings.php to do automatic updates.
* Don't block UTF-8 titles containing byte 0xA0 (bug added in 1.3.2)
* Watch/unwatch tabs now shown on edit pages in MonoBook.
* Fix default skin in Irish localization (ga)
* Add Traditional Chinese localization (zh-tw)
* Changed default sortkey of subcategories. Don't include "Category:"-prefix
  any longer
* More helpful info on spam catcher.
* Allow larger offsets for queries such as Special:Listusers
* Semicolon (;) added to French non-break space rules
* Possible fix for some install errors with path names permission problems.
* Removed [[Project:All system messages]], which has been superceded by
  the much faster [[Special:Allmessages]]. This speeds up installation
  considerably.

== Version 1.3.2, 2004-08-30 ==

Changes from 1.3.1:
* Fix namespaced page creation links when no go match
* When cookies are disabled, don't show login screen twice
* Install should no longer die when PHP is pre-configured to compress output
* Fixed bug that caused long Japanese pages to time out with Tidy active
* When session.handler is set incorrectly, try automatic override to 'files'
* Watch/Unwatch links back to the affected page instead of Main Page
* Upload link no longer displayed on Monobook if uploading is disabled
* Special:Allmessages faster, shows correct original text, works in safe mode


== Version 1.3.1, 2004-08-14 ==

Changes from 1.3.0:
* Watchlist parameters now work with register_globals off
* Fixed parsing of ''italics'' and '''bold''' mark-up (again)
* Special:Allpages display is more sensible on smaller wikis
* Fixed XHTML parsing error in classic skins
* Moved pages update watchlist correctly
* Fixed rebuildall.php on case-sensitive Unix filesystems
* Disabled file cache compression by default due to incompatibility
  with output buffer compression (ob_gzhandler)
* New magic word PAGENAMEE (URL-escaped version of PAGENAME)
* Installation avoids blank username; better message on missing XML module

== Version 1.3.0, 2004-08-11 ==

Look & layout:
* New default layout 'MonoBook' (available on PHP4 only currently)
* Print stylesheet now built-in to every page
* More or less correct XHTML 1.0 (served as text/html by default)

Wiki features:
* Image captions can now include links and other basic formatting
* Image bounding box can be specified instead of width, e.g. as
  100x100px, making the image not wider than 100px and not higher
  than 100px, keeping aspect ratio.
* Templates have been expanded with parameters, and separated from
  the MediaWiki: localization scheme.
* Categories more or less work
* added a special page for listing users with sysop rights.

Editing:
* Automatic merging of edit conflicts that don't directly interfere
* Edit summaries can now include basic formatting and links

Metadata and output:
* Linked Creative Commons copyright metadata (optional)
* RSS 2.0 & Atom 0.3 feeds for Recent Changes, New Pages

Optional modules:
* WikiHiero hieroglyphic module can be added (separate download)
* Timeline module can be added (separate download).
  Requires ploticus.
* TeX now has an experimental MathML output mode (incomplete!)

Installation and upgrading:
* The old install.php and update.php have been removed. In-place
  installation introduced in 1.2 is now the standard installation
  and upgrade method, see INSTALL and UPGRADE for directions.

Database:
* The links table has been changed to use a cur_id for l_from.
  The link tables must be converted on upgrade, which may entail
  some downtime.

Code and compatibility:
* Should now run clean with error reporting set to E_ALL.
* register_globals hack from 1.2 has been replaced with safer code
* Bundled PHPTAL 0.7.0 from http://phptal.sourceforge.net/
  (with some patches)
* Most image-related code moved to Image.php
* More fixes for PHP 4.1.2 (thanks to Asheesh Laroia)
* URL encoding fix for anchors
* All languages now available in UTF-8 mode
* Various other fixes

=== Caveats ===

Some output, particularly involving user-supplied inline HTML, may not
produce 100% valid or well-formed XHTML output. Testers are welcome to
set $wgMimeType = "application/xhtml+xml"; to test for remaining problem
cases, but this is not recommended on live sites. (This must be set for
MathML to display properly in Mozilla.)

The new 'MonoBook' skin is not compatible with PHP 5 due to bugs in the
underlying PHPTAL library. It will be automatically disabled when running
on PHP5; the older look and feel will be used instead.

  privilege, such as the 'Developer' account created by the install.

Fixes and tweaks:
* Now works with register_globals off!

  The old names are provided too for compatibility, but make sure they don't
  conflict if you've been putting other files in your wiki.
* Uploaded filenames are more strictly checked than before. See bits in
  DefaultSettings.php to tweak this behavior to your needs.
* Database messages are now enabled by default, so the interface messages can
  be tweaked through the wiki with a sysop account. Disable this if you
  don't want the performance hit.

=== Database changes ===

An index was added to recentchanges table to speed up Newpages
(patch-rc-newindex.sql for manual updaters).

Expiration date field has been added to ipblocks table
(patch-ipb_expiry.sql for manual updaters).


== Version 1.1.0, 2003-12-08 ==

This is the new production release. Any following 1.1.x releases are expected
to contain only bug fixes; developments of new features will go towards a 1.2.0
release.

New features in 1.1:

  http://meta.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki_User%27s_Guide:_Using_tables
* User-editable interface messages:
  http://meta.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki_namespace

New translations:
* fi - Finnish

* sk - Slovak
* ta - Tamil

=== Database changes ===

"linkscc" table added. If upgrading manually (rather than with update.php),
run maintenance/archives/patch-linkscc.sql to create the table.

Older releases were dated snapshots from the old 'stable' branch:

== mediawiki-20031118 ==

* Image deletion fixed.
* Deletion of image old revisions now restricted to sysops
  (this is an irreversible action and not well logged)
* Fixed maintenance scripts broken by last release's security fix
* Many errors in rebuildlinks script fixed.

== mediawiki-20031117 ==

* SECURITY FIX: stricter checking of include path
* Fixed user contributions next/prev bug
* Login cookies now have the database name prefixed to allow wikis
  to coexist in the same domain. This will invalidate any old saved
  password cookies.
* Update cache timestamp when talk pages are created
* Saving the login form in Mozilla no longer blanks password in prefs.
* Check existence of source page before performing a move.
* Detect invalid titles in Special:Allpages
* Q-encode headers on outgoing inter-user e-mail

* Protected pages no longer appear unprotected when visited via redirect
* Swapped old Wikipedia logo for the MediaWiki sunflower logo
* install.php, update.php print warning on old PHP versions,
  added compatibility functions that might or might not help

No database changes since 20031107; upgrading should be clean.


== mediawiki-20031107 ==

* Fixed various bugs!
* Some speed improvements from tweaks to the table indexes
* Limited support for memcached (see below)
* New translations (see below)
* Interwiki link data now kept in database for flexibility
* Friendlier read-only source view if asked to edit a page when
  the db is locked or the page is protected.
* Normal IP blocks auto-expire after 24 hours
* Optional support for blocking usernames
* Uploads disabled by default (see below)


=== Security note ===

Uploads are now disabled by default. If you've set up a secure configuration
you can reenable uploads by putting:

  $wgDisableUploads = false;

into LocalSettings.php.

Earlier versions of MediaWiki included a bug that potentially allows logged-
in users to delete arbitrary files in directories writable by the web server
user by manually feeding false form data; this is now fixed.

As a reminder, disable PHP script execution in the upload directory!
You may also wish to serve HTML pages as plaintext to prevent cookie-
stealing JavaScript attacks. Example Apache config fragment:

  <Directory "/Library/MediaWiki/web/upload">
     # Ignore .htaccess files
     AllowOverride None
     
     # Serve HTML as plaintext
     AddType text/plain .html .htm .shtml
     
     # Don't run arbitrary PHP code.
     php_admin_flag engine off
     
     # If you've other scripting languages, disable them too.
  </Directory>


=== Database updates ===

If you're using update.php, the necessary database changes should
be made automatically.

To manually upgrade your database from the 2003-08-29 release, run the
following SQL scripts from the maintenance subdirectory:

  archives/patch-ipblocks.sql
  archives/patch-interwiki.sql
  archives/patch-indexes.sql
  interwiki.sql

To copy in the Wikipedia language-prefix interwikis as well, add:

  wikipedia-interwiki.sql


=== Translations ===

New interface localization files are included for:
  fy Frisian
  ro Romanian
  sl Slovene
  sq Albanian
  sr Serbian


=== Memcached ===

Memcached is a distributed cache system. See http://www.danga.com/memcached/
MediaWiki can optionally use memcached to store some data between calls
to reduce load on the database. Currently this is limited to user and
talk page notification data, interwiki prefix/URL matches, and the
UTF-8 conversion tables.

MediaWiki includes version 1.0.10 of the (GPL'd) PHP memcached client by
Ryan Gilfether; if memcached is disabled it acts as a dummy object with
minimal overhead.

To use memcached you'll need PHP installed with sockets support (this is not
in the default configure options). See docs/memcached for some more details.

Additionally, you can store login session data in memcached instead of the
local filesystem, which can help to enable load-balancing by letting login
sessions transparently work on multiple front-end web servers. (The primary
other issue is with uploads, which requires some care in handling.)

To enable this, set $wgSessionsInMemcached = true; and set $wgCookieDomain
appropriately if exposing multiple hostnames. This system is new and may be
volatile; login sessions will fail dramatically if memcached is unavailable
when this option is turned on.


=== Online documentation ===

Documentation for both end-users and site administrators is currently being
built up on Meta-Wikipedia, and is covered under the GNU Free Documentation
License:

  http://meta.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki_User%27s_Guide


=== Mailing list ===

A MediaWiki-l mailing list has been set up distinct from the Wikipedia
wikitech-l list:

  http://mail.wikipedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-l


=== UseModWiki import script ===

A stripped-down UseModWiki import script is available in the maintenance
subdirectory. It is incomplete and requires a lot of manual clean-up, but
does function for the brave and pure of heart.


=== Test suite removed ===

The unmaintained Java-based test suite has been removed from the tarball
release. If you really want it you can check it out from CVS.


== mediawiki-20030829 ==

First release under MediaWiki name.
