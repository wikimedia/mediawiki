Change notes from older releases. For current info see RELEASE-NOTES.

== MediaWiki 1.12 ==

This is the Winter 2007 quarterly release.

MediaWiki is now using a "continuous integration" development model with
quarterly snapshot releases. The latest development code is always kept
"ready to run", and in fact runs our own sites on Wikipedia.

Release branches will continue to receive security updates for about a year
from first release, but nonessential bugfixes and feature developments
will be made on the development trunk and appear in the next quarterly release.

Those wishing to use the latest code instead of a branch release can obtain
it from source control: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Download_from_SVN

=== Configuration changes in 1.12 ===
* Marking edits as bot edits with Special:Contributions?bot=1 now requires the
  markbotedit permission, rather than the rollback permission previously used.
  This permission is assigned by default to the sysop group.
* MediaWiki now checks if serialized files are out of date. New configuration
  variable $wgCheckSerialized can be set to false to enable old behavior (i.e.
  to not check and assume they are always up to date)
* The rollback permission can now be rate-limited using the normal mechanism.
* New configuration variable $wgExtraLanguageNames
* Behaviour of $wgAddGroups and $wgRemoveGroups changed. New behaviour:
* * Granting the userrights privilege allows arbitrary changing of rights.
* * Without the userrights privilege, a user will be able to add and/or
     remove the groups specified in $wgAddGroups and $wgRemoveGroups for
     any groups they are in.
* New permission userrights-interwiki for changing user rights on foreign wikis.
* $wgImplictGroups for groups that are hidden from Special:Listusers, etc.
* $wgAutopromote: automatically promote users who match specified criteria
* $wgGroupsAddToSelf, $wgGroupsRemoveFromSelf: allow users to add or remove
  themselves from specified groups via Special:Userrights.
* When $wgUseTidy has been enabled, PHP's Tidy module is now used if it is
  present, in preference to an external Tidy executable which may or may not
  be present. To force use of external Tidy even when the PHP module is
  available, set $wgTidyInternal to false.


=== New features in 1.12 ===
* (bug 10735) Add a warning for non-descriptive filenames at Special:Upload
* Add {{filepath:}} parser function to get full path to an uploaded file,
  complementing {{fullurl:}} for pages.
* (bug 11136) If using Postgres, search path is explicitly set if wgDBmwschema
  is not set to 'mediawiki', allowing multiple mediawiki instances per user.

* (bug 5412) Add feed links for the site to all pages
* (bug 11353) Add ability to retrieve raw section content via action=raw

* isValidEmailAddr hook added to User method of that name, to allow, e.g., re-
  stricting e-mail addresses to a specific domain

  click it. Existing clear links will fall back to the raw editor, which is
  very easy to clear your watchlist with.

  on Special:Newpages
* LogLine hook added to allow formatting custom entries in Special:Log.
* Support for Iranian calendar

  user page
* Added --override switch for disabled pages in updateSpecialPages.php
* Provide a unique message (ipb_blocked_as_range) if unblock of a single IP
  fails
  because it is part of a blocked range.
* (bug 3973) Use a separate message for the email content when an account is
  created by another user
* dumpTextPass.php can spawn fetchText.php as a subprocess, which should restart
  cleanly if database connections fail unpleasantly.
* (bug 12028) Add Special:Listbots as shortcut for Special:Listusers/bot
* (bug 9633) Add a predefined list of delete reasons to the deletion form

  makes no sense, and there should be no "Return to [[Page]]" link.
* (bug 12486) Protected titles now give a warning for privileged editors.
* (bug 9939) Special:Search now sets focus to search input box when no existing
  search is active
* For Special:Userrights, use GET instead of POST to search for users.
* Allow subpage syntax for Special:Userrights, i.e., Special:Userrights/Name.
* When submitting changes on Special:Userrights, show the full form again, not
  just the search box.
* Added exception hooks
* (bug 12574) Allow bots to specify whether an edit should be marked as a bot
  edit, via the parameter 'bot'. (Default: '1')

  address in Reply-To instead of From for user-to-user emails.
  This protects against SPF problems and privacy-leaking bounce messages
  when using mailers that set the envelope sender to the From header value.
* (bug 11897) Add alias [[Special:CreateAccount]] & [[Special:Userlogin/signup]]
  for Special:Userlogin?type=signup
* (bug 12214) Add a predefined list of delete reasons to the file deletion form
* Merged backends for OpenSearch suggestions and AJAX search.
  Both now accept namespace prefixes, handle 'Media:' and 'Special:' pages,
  and reject interwiki prefixes. PrefixSearch class centralizes this code,
  and the backend part can be overridden by the PrefixSearchBackend hook.
* (bug 10365) Localization of Special:Version
* When installing using Postgres, the Pl/Pgsql language is now checked for 
  and installed when at the superuser level.
* The default robot policy for the entire wiki is now configurable via the
  $wgDefaultRobotPolicy setting.

* (bug 12857) Patrol link on new pages should clear floats
* (bug 12968) Render redirect wikilinks in a redirect class for customization

== Parser changes in 1.12 ==

For help with migration to the MediaWiki 1.12 parser, please visit:

http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Migration_to_the_new_preprocessor

The parser pass order has changed from

   * Extension tag strip and render
   * HTML normalisation and security
   * Template expansion
   * Main section...

to

   * Template and extension tag parse to intermediate representation
   * Template expansion and extension rendering
   * HTML normalisation and security
   * Main section...

The main effect of this for the user is that the rules for uncovered syntax
have changed.

Uncovered main-pass syntax, such as HTML tags, are now generally valid, whereas
previously in some cases they were escaped. For example, you could have "<ta" in
one template, and "ble>" in another template, and put them together to make a
valid <table> tag. Previously the result would have been "&lt;table&gt;".

Uncovered preprocessor syntax is generally not recognised. For example, if you
have "{{a" in Template:A and "b}}" in Template:B, then "{{a}}{{b}}" will be
converted to a literal "{{ab}}" rather than the contents of Template:Ab. This
was the case previously in HTML output mode, and is now uniformly the case in
the other modes as well. HTML-style comments uncovered by template expansion
will not be recognised by the preprocessor and hence will not prevent template
expansion within them, but they will be stripped by the following HTML security
pass.

Bug 5678 has been fixed. This has a number of user-visible effects related to
the removal of this double-parse. Please see the wiki page for examples. 

Message transformation mode has been removed, and replaced with "preprocess"
mode. This means that some MediaWiki namespace messages may need to be updated,
especially ones which took advantage of the terribly counterintuitive behaviour
of the former message mode. 

The header identification routines for section edit and for numbering section
edit links have been merged. This removes a significant failure mode and fixes a
whole category of bugs (tracked by bug #4899). Wikitext headings uncovered by
template expansion will still be rendered into a heading tag, and will get an 
entry in the TOC, but will not have a section edit link. HTML-style headings 
will also not have a section edit link. Valid wikitext headings present in the 
template source text will get a template section edit link. This is a major 
break from previous behaviour, but I believe the effects are almost entirely 
beneficial.

The main motivation for making these changes was performance. The new two-pass
preprocessor can skip "dead branches" in template expansion, such as unfollowed
#switch cases and unused defaults for template arguments. This provides a
significant performance improvement in template-heavy test cases taken from
Wikipedia. Parser function hooks can participate in this performance improvement
by using the new SFH_OBJECT_ARGS flag during registration.

The pre-expand include size limit has been removed, since there's no efficient
way to calculate such a figure, and it would now be meaningless for performance
anyway. The "preprocessor node count" takes its place, with a generous default
limit.

The context in which XML-style extension tags are called has changed, so
extensions which make use of the parser state may need compatibility changes.

The new preprocessor syntax has been documented in Backus-Naur Form at:

http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Preprocessor_ABNF

The ExpandTemplates extension now has the ability to generate an XML parse 
tree from wikitext source. This parse tree corresponds closely to the grammar
documented on that page.

== MediaWiki 1.11 ==

This is the Summer 2007 branch release of MediaWiki.

MediaWiki is now using a "continuous integration" development model with
quarterly snapshot releases. The latest development code is always kept
"ready to run", and in fact runs our own sites on Wikipedia.

Release branches will continue to receive security updates for about a year
from first release, but nonessential bugfixes and feature developments
will be made on the development trunk and appear in the next quarterly release.

Those wishing to use the latest code instead of a branch release can obtain
it from source control: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Download_from_SVN

== Configuration changes since 1.10 ==

* $wgThumbUpright - Adjust width of upright images when parameter 'upright' is
  used
* $wgAddGroups, $wgRemoveGroups - Finer control over who can assign which
  usergroups
* $wgEnotifImpersonal, $wgEnotifUseJobQ - Bulk mail options for large sites
* $wgShowHostnames - Expose server host names through the API and HTML comments
* $wgSaveDeletedFiles has been removed, the feature is now enabled unconditionally

  related to landscape images on a page without nailing the width of upright
  images to a fix value which makes views for anon unproportional and user
  preferences useless

  Forgetting to give a 'true' return value is a very common error which tends

== MediaWiki 1.10 ==

This is the Spring 2007 branch release of MediaWiki.

MediaWiki is now using a "continuous integration" development model with
quarterly snapshot releases. The latest development code is always kept
"ready to run", and in fact runs our own sites on Wikipedia.

Release branches will continue to receive security updates for about a year
from first release, but nonessential bugfixes and feature developments 
will be made on the development trunk and appear in the next quarterly release.

Those wishing to use the latest code instead of a branch release can obtain
it from source control: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Download_from_SVN

== Configuration changes ==

* A new switch $wgCommandLineDarkBg used by maintenance scripts (parserTests.php).
  It lets you specify if your terminal use a dark background, the colorized
  output will be made lighter making things easier to read.
* The minimum permissions needed to edit a page in each namespace can now be 
  customized via the $wgNamespaceProtection array. By default, editing pages in
  the MediaWiki namespace requires "editinterface" permission, as before.
* Allow restriction of autoconfirmed permission by edit count. New global setting
  $wgAutoConfirmCount (defaulting to zero, naturally).
* Added rate limiter for Special:Emailuser
* Private logs can now be created using $wgLogRestrictions
* (Bug 8590) limited HTML is now always enabled ($wgUserHtml = true).
* Deprecated $wgUseImageResize, thumbnailing will be enabled unconditionally.

* Introduce "cascading protection" -- implicit protection on pages transcluded
  into a page protected with this option enabled
* (bug 8567) Added hook RawPageViewBeforeOutput just before the text is blown
  out in action=raw, so extensions might influence the output.
* (bug 3446) Add user preference to hide page content below diffs, can be
  overridden by adding diffonly=1 or diffonly=0 to the URL of the diff page

  format as block expiry dates. Existing protections are assumed to be infinite,
  as are protections made with the new field left blank.

  keywords
* (bug 6987) Allow perrow, widths, and heights attributes for <gallery>

  disabled in the wiki's default language (by setting to "-"), they'll also
  be disabled in other languages too (e.g. if the user specifies uselang=fr).
* Sort log types in Special:Log
* Added a classname ("mw-toolbar-editbutton") and unique IDs to the edit
  toolbar buttons

  the deadly, hard-to-escape UTF-7.
    This fixes an issue with the Ajax interface error message on MSIE when

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.10 requires PHP 5 (5.1 recommended). PHP 4 is no longer supported.

PHP 5.0.x fails on 64-bit systems due to serious bugs with array processing:
http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=34879
Upgrade affected systems to PHP 5.1 or higher.

MySQL 3.23.x is no longer supported; some older hosts may need to upgrade.
At this time we still recommend 4.0, but 4.1/5.0 will work fine in most cases.


== Upgrading ==

1.10 has several database changes since 1.9, and will not work without schema
updates.

If upgrading from before 1.7, you may want to run refreshLinks.php to ensure
new database fields are filled with data.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, some major database
changes are made, and there is a slightly higher chance that things could
break. Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.

= MediaWiki release notes =

Security reminder: MediaWiki does not require PHP's register_globals
setting since version 1.2.0. If you have it on, turn it *off* if you can.

  make CheckUser.php and the new retroactive autoblock functionality faster.

* (bug 6737) Fixes for MySQL 5 schema in strict mode
* Approximate height for client-side scaling fallback instead of passing -1
  into the HTML output.
* Make the DNSBL to check for proxy blocking configurable via $wgSorbsUrl
* Add experimental recording/reporting mode to parser tests runner, to
  compare changes against the previous run.
  Additional tables 'testrun' and 'testitem' are in maintenance/testRunner.sql,
  source this and pass --record option to parserTests.php
* Make the set of default parser test input files extensible via
  $wgParserTestFiles. This can now be appended to by extensions or local
  configuration files so that extension or custom tests can be automatically
  run along with the main batch.
* Run PHP install version checks on update.php so command-line updaters see
  new version requirements
* Do a check for the PHP 5.0.x 64-bit bug, since this is much more disruptive
  as of MW 1.8 than it used to be. Install or upgrade now aborts with a
  warning and a request to upgrade.
* (bug 6440) Updated indexes to improve backlinking queries (links, templates, images)
* Switched 'anon-only' block mode to default for IP blocks
* (bug 3687, 7892) Add distinct heading for media files in category display,

  and user JS subpages.

* (bug 2001) Tables with class="sortable" can now be dynamically sorted via
  JavaScript.
* Added autosummary for new pages with 500 or less characters, and refactor
   the autosummary code so it's all done in one function. doEdit is getting too
   big!
* (bug 7554) The correct MIME type for SVG images is now displayed on the
  image page (image/svg+xml, not image/svg).
* (bug 7883) Added autoblock whitelisting feature, using which specific ranges
   can be protected from autoblocking. These ranges are specified, in list format,
   in the autoblock_whitelist system message.
* Added placeholders for text injection by hooks to EditPage.php
* (bug 8009) Automatic edit summary for redirects is not filled for edits in existing pages
* Installer support for experimental MySQL 4.1/5.0 binary-safe schema
* Use INSERT IGNORE for db-based BagOStuff add/insert, for more memcache-like
  behavior when keys already exist on add (instead of dying with an error...)

  member variable for text injection into the form, which can be filled by the hooks.
* (bug 6295) Add a "revision patching" functionality, where an edit can be undone
  (with a functionality similar to diff rev1 rev2 | patch -R rev3 -o rev3).
  This is triggered by including &undo=revid in an edit URL. A link to a URL
  that will undo a given edit is shown on NEW revision headers on diff pages.
  The link leads to a "Show Changes" page showing what will be done to undo the
  edit.
* Fix display of link in "already rolled back" message for image/category pages
* (bug 6016) Left-aligned images should stack vertically, like right-aligned
  images, not horizontally.
* Patch from LeonWP: added UploadForm:BeforeProcessing hook in SpecialUpload.php
* Add AuthPluginSetup hook to override $wgAuth after configuration
* Fix regression in authentication hook auto-creation on login
* (bug 8110) Allow spaces in ISBNs
* (bug 8024) Introduce "send me copies of emails I send to others" preference
* Added 'EditPage::attemptSave' hook before an article is saved.
* (bug 8083) Applied patch for sk localisation
* Add a backslash character to the edit token, to prevent edits via certain
  broken proxies that mangle such characters in form submissions
* (bug 7461) Allow overwriting pages using importTextFile.php
* (bug 7946) importTextFile.php doesn't perform pre-save transform
* (bug 8117) {{REVISIONTIMESTAMP}} showed weird default if $wgLocalTZoffset set;
  now uses current time for previews and if timestamp can't be loaded from DB
* {{REVISIONTIMESTAMP}} now uses site local timezone instead of user timezone
  to ensure consistent behavior
* {{REVISIONTIMESTAMP}} and friends should now work on non-MySQL backends
* (bug 7671) Observe canonical media namespace prefix in Linker::formatComment
* Added js variable wgCurRevisionId to the output
* (bug 8141) Cleanup of Parser::doTableStuff, patch by AzaTht
* (bug 8042) Make miser mode caching limits settable via $wgQueryCacheLimit
  instead of hardcoding to 1000
* Enable QueryPage classes to override list formatting
* (bug 5485) Show number of intervening revisions in diff view
* (bug 8100) Fix XHTML validity in Taiwanese localization
* Added redirect to section feature. Use it wisely.
* Added a configuration variable allowing the "break out of framesets" feature
  to be switched on and off ($wgBreakFrames). Off by default.
* Allow Xml::check() $attribs parameter to override 'value' attribute
* DB schema change: added two columns (rc_old_len and rc_new_len) to the recentchanges table to store
  the text lengths before and after the edit
* (bug 1085) Made Special:Recentchanges show the character difference between the changed revisions
* Removed a redundant <strong> tag from diff pages that was causing display issues for some users
* (bug 8203) The keyboard shortcut for "log out" was removed, because users were pressing it
  when they intended to press the shortcut for "preview".
* (bug 8148) Handle non-removable output buffers gracefully when cleaning
  buffers for HTTP 304 responses, StreamFile, and Special:Export.
  Duplicated code merged into wfResetOutputBuffers() and wfClearOutputBuffers()
* Special:AllPages : 'next page' link now point to the first title of the next
  chunk instead of pointing to the last title of current chunk.
* (bug 4673) Special:AllPages : add a 'previous' link (new message 'prevpage')
* (bug 8121) wfRandom() was not between 0 and 1
* Add static method Parser::createAssocArgs($args), so parser functions can
  use the same code to parse arguments as the templates do.
* Change behavior of logins using the temporary e-mailed password (as stored
  in user_newpassword hash field). Instead of just logging in silently and
  leaving the previous user_password field in place indefinitely, the user
  is now prompted to set a new password.

  The password-changing form is at Special:Resetpass; currently it's only
  usable for changing from the temporary password during login, but it
  could perhaps be generalized, replacing the subform in preferences.

  Once the new password is set successfully, the temporary password is wiped
  so it cannot be used to login a second time, and the login process
  is completed.
* Suppress 'mail new password' button on login form if $wgAuth forbids
  changing user passwords; it wouldn't work very well...
* Consolidate password length checks and $wgAuth manipulation into
  User::setPassword() to avoid duplicate code in different places
  that set passwords.
* User::setPassword() now throws PasswordError exceptions if the password
  is illegal or cannot be set via $wgAuth. These can be caught and a human-
  readable error message displayed by UI code.
* Added Title::isSubpage()
* (bug 8241) Don't consider user pages of User:Foo.css to be CSS subpages
* Set an explicit class on framed thumbnail inner divs and images, changed some
  CSS to use these instead of using descendent selectors.
* Accept null parameter to User::setPassword() as indicating the password
  field should be cleared to an unusable state. Login will only be possible
  after the password is reset, for instance by e-mail.
* (bug 6394) Invalidate the password set for "by e-mail" account creations
  to avoid accidental empty password creations.
* Made the show change size function work on page moves, page creations, and
  log entries. Also fixed it in the javascript recentchanges.
* (bug 8239) correctly get 50 new contributions when clicking '(50 next)'
* (bug 2259) Fix old regression where e-mail addresses were no longer
  confirmed on login with mailed password.
* Add a notification about the confirmation mail sent during account
  creation, so people don't immediately go off to request a second one.
* Add a warning on Special:Confirmemail if a code was already sent and has
  not yet expired.
* Add user_editcount field to provide data for heuristics on account use.
  Incremented on edit, with lazy initialization from past revision data.
  Can batch-initialize with maintenance/initEditCount.php (not yet friendly
  to replication environments, this will do all accounts in one query).
* Allow raw SQL subsections in Database::update() SET portion as well as
  for WHERE portion. Handy for increments and such.
* User::getOption now accept a default value to override default user values
  this makes it consistent with WebRequest::get* methods. Corrected code in
  various places accordingly.
* (bug 8264) Fix JavaScript global vars for XHTML mode
* Make $wgSiteNotice value wikitext again, for consistency with editable
  MediaWiki:Sitenotice and MediaWiki:Anonnotice.
* (bug 8044) When redirecting from the canonical name of the special page
  to the localised one, parameters/subpages are omitted
* (bug 8164) Special:Booksources should use GET for form submission
* Rewrite Special:Booksources to clean up interface and remove redundant code
* (bug 7925) Change Special:Allmessages message name filter javascript to be
  a bit more responsive and easier on the CPU
* (bug 4488) Support watching pages on deletion; introduces new user preference
* Minor restructuring of Special:Preferences; "watch pages I edit" and "watch
  pages I create" options now accessible under "Watchlist" options
* (bug 8153) <nowiki> doesn't work in site notice
* (bug 6690) wfMsgNoTrans() transforms messages
* (bug 8274) Wrap edit tools in a <div> with a specified class
* Detect PHP 5.0.x 64-bit bug and abort in WebStart.php; too many things break
  mysteriously otherwise (detection code copied from install-utils.inc)
* (bug 8295) Change handling of <center> tags in doBlockLevels() to match that
  of <div>
* (bug 8110) Make magic ISBN linking stricter: only match ten-digit sequences
  (plus optional ISBN-13 prefix) with no immediately following alphanumeric
  character, disallow multiple consecutive internal redirects
* (bug 2785) Accept optional colon prefix in links when formatting comments
* Don't show "you can view and copy the source of this page" message for
  pages which don't exist
* (bug 8310) Blank line added to top of 'post' when page is blank
* (bug 8109) Template parameters ignored in "recentchangestext"
* Gracefully skip redirect-to-fragment on WebKit versions less than 420;
  it messes up on current versions of Safari but is ok in the latest
  nightlies. Checking the version number will allow it to automatically
  work when new releases of Safari appear.
* Fix regression in thumb styles; size and padding didn't match with
  new arrangement.
* (bug 8333) Fix quick user data update on login password change on
  replication database setups. User data is now pulled from master
  instead of slave in User::loadFromDatabase, ensuring that it is
  fresh and accurate when read and then saved back into cache.
  This was breaking with the Special:Rename operation which
  automatically logs the user in with the new password after changing
  it; pulling from slave meant the record was often not the updated
  one.
* (bug 8335) Set image width to the first valid parameter found.
* (bug 8350) Fix watchlist viewing bug when using Postgres.
* (bug 6603) When warning about invalid file extensions, output the bit
  of the extension we actually checked
* (bug 7669) Drop defaults on BLOB/TEXT columns for better compatibility
  with MySQL's strict mode, often enabled by the Windows installer.
  The defaults are ignored anyway when strict mode is off...
* (bug 7685) Use explicit values for ar_text and ar_flags when deleting,
  for better compatibility with MySQL's strict mode
* Update default interwiki values to reflect changed location of ursine:
* (bug 5411) Remove autopatrol preference
* Users who have the "autopatrol" permission will have their edits marked as
  patrolled automatically
* Users who do not have the "autopatrol" permission will no longer be able
  to mark their own edits as patrolled
* Introduce 'PingLimiter' hook; see docs/hooks.txt for more information
* (bug 532) Tweaked alt text for some interface messages
* (bug 8231) Gave useful alt text to the main <img> on image pages
* (bug 371) Remove alt text for "Enlarge" icon on thumbnails
* Initialize user_editcount to 0 instead of NULL for newly created accounts
* (bug 3696) Strip LRM and RLM characters from titles to work around the
  problem some people have where titles cut-and-pasted from lists include
  the bidi override characters appended to the lists.
  A more thorough blacklist for forbidden and translatable characters would
  be wise, though, as might a cleaner method for the lists in the first place.
* Fix regression in email password resets on read-restricted sites
* Set tabindex on fields in deletion form so you don't have to tab through
  the links in the sitenotice
* (bug 8271) Show full time and date on viewer for individual deleted
  revisions
* (bug 8214) Output file size limit and actual file size in appropriate units
  on Special:Upload
* (bug 8016) Purge objectcache table during upgrade processes - use the --nopurge
  option to prevent this when running maintenance/update.php
* (bug 7612) Remove superfluous link to Special:Categories from result items
  on Special:Mostcategories
* {{PLURAL:}} now handles formatted numbers correctly
* (bug 8331) Added the change size value to watchlists; therefore made
  watchlists use RecentChange::newFromRow() instead of newFromCurRow()
* (bug 8351) Fix undo for simple reverts
* (bug 6856) User::clearNotification() does not respect read-only mode
* (bug 6853) Use a checkbox on the installer form to indicate that a superuser
  account should be used; this is clearer than the old check which relied on
  the password never being an obscure value
* Remove old unused watchlist cache, which was a leftover from the old schema
  where watchlists were more expensive to generate
* Minor cosmetic changes to Special:Userrights
* Added wgCanonicalSpecialPageName to JavaScript variables
* Fix image deleting when using Postgres.
* Output both source and destination titles in maintenance/moveBatch.php
* Added basic parser tests for language variants
* Enable selflinks and categories to be written in some of the language variants
* Prevent conversion of JavaScript code in language variants
* Output software version number in maintenance/parserTests.php
* (bug 7169) Use Ajax to watch/unwatch articles if enabled
* Make variant table caching a little more robust, using main language code
  in cache key. Probably this is still a bit wonky, though. Was breaking
  parser tests when Chinese tables were getting loaded into Serbian code.
* (bug 8380) Be nicer about blank lines in deleteBatch.php
* (bug 8401) Fix regression in SORBS lookup for some DNS setups
* Use raw file descriptor in posix_isatty() check to avoid warning on
  Linux systems with at least some versions of PHP
* (bug 5908) Allow overriding the default category sort key for all items on
  a page using {{DEFAULTSORT}}
* (bug 6449) Throw a more definitive error message when installation fails
  due to an invalid database name
* (bug 5827) Use full text for option link labels on Special:Watchlist
* (bug 8018) Allow hiding minor edits from the watchlist
* (bug 8427) MonoBook RTL IE 7.0 tweaks failed when sidebar's navigation
  section is renamed; no longer relies on first section name
* Stabilize client-side table sorting even if the underlying Javascript sort()
  implementation is unstable
* Add hook for extensions to add user information to the panel in preferences,
  next to the user name and ID.
* (bug 8392) Display protection status of transcluded pages in the edit page
  template list. Patch by Fyren, with i18n naming tweak.
* Fix for interwiki transclusion where target wiki uses query string for title
* Resolve namespaces on interwiki Title objects using canonical namespace names
  if possible (should not happen, though, outside interwiki transclusion... and
  maybe not even then, but it does)
* (bug 8447) Fix SQL typo breaking non-default $wgHitcounterUpdateFreq

== 1.8 Compatibility changes ==

=== Zend Optimizer ===

A bug in some versions of PHP 5 and Zend Optimizer which was triggered under
MediaWiki 1.8.x has been worked around by disabling some internal debugging
features when Zend Optimizer is loaded. This should solve some common
"blank page" problems.

=== PHP 5.0 64-bit ===

MediaWiki now checks for a condition where PHP 5.0.x corrupts array data
on 64-bit systems and warns you to upgrade PHP to solve the problem. This
bug causes Special: pages to fail on affected systems under MediaWiki 1.8
and higher, and subtler data corruption on earlier versions.

The only known workaround is to upgrade PHP to 5.1 or later, which you
probably should do anyway for security reasons!

=== MySQL 5 ===

MediaWiki should now install and run correctly on MySQL 5.0 and higher when
MySQL's "strict mode" is enabled. (This is now the default for many Windows
installations, though it seems to remain off by default on Unix.)

This fixes errors about "cannot default default value for BLOB/TEXT fields".

=== ImageMagick ===

Note that ImageMagick older than 6.x may no longer work for image resizing
due to use of the -thumbnail option.


== 1.8 Behavior changes ==

=== Localized special pages ===

The names of Special: pages can now be localized, so links and URLs to them
are more legible in languages that aren't English.

Not all languages have included localized names yet.

=== E-mail password ===

Users are now required to set a new password for themselves when they first
log in with a newly generated e-mailed password.

Requesting passwords frequently is prevented to reduce abusive mailbombing.

=== Undo revision ===

An "undo" link now appears in diff view for easier reverting of older edits.
When GNU diff3 is available for edit conflict merging, this can make it much
easier to "undo" the changes of an older edit when there are surrounding
changes elsewhere in the page.

The changes must be manually reviewed and approved, as with conventional
full-revision reverts.

=== Blocking ===

User blocks can be set to disable the automatic blocking of IP addresses the
account logs in with.


== 1.8 Database changes ==

* new 'redirect' table stores data on page redirects
* new 'querycachetwo' table used for some cached special pages
* 'ipblocks' table adds 'ipb_enable_autoblock'
* 'recentchanges' table adds 'rc_old_len', 'rc_new_len' for size tracking
* 'user' table has added 'user_newpass_time' and 'user_editcount' fields
* some indexes have been updated on 'recentchanges'

== 1.8 Configuration changes ==

Several configuration options have changed since 1.8:

=== $wgEnableAPI ===

The experimental machine API interface is now enabled by default, read-only.
You can disable it by setting $wgEnableAPI = false; in LocalSettings.php.

=== $wgPathInfo ===

The use of PATH_INFO (the text after the script name in 'index.php/Blah')
is controlled by the $wgUsePathInfo setting. This is now explicitly disabled
for CGI, apache2filter, and ISAPI configurations of PHP, for more consistency
with the autodetection from the installer.

In some rarer configurations you may have to switch $wgUsePathInfo from false
to true or, perhaps, from true to false to make things work properly if bad
PATH_INFO data comes through the server.

The wiki now tries to detect this condition and should show you an error
message describing what to change instead of sending the browser into an
infinite redirect loop.

=== $wgScript and other path settings ===

The following configuration variables are now automatically set in Setup.php
if they are not overridden in LocalSettings.php:

from $wgScriptPath:
 + $wgScript
 |  \- $wgArticlePath
 + $wgRedirectScript
 + $wgStylePath
 + $wgUploadPath
    \- $wgLogo
     + $wgMathPath

from $IP:
 - $wgStyleDirectory
 + $wgUploadDirectory
   \- $wgMathDirectory
    + $wgTmpDirectory

Newly generated configuration files will by default include only $wgScriptPath
(hardcoded from the installer) and $IP (detected at runtime).

Old configuration files which specify all these values explicitly should
continue to work just fine, but if you use the defaults you can remove them
to reduce clutter.

=== $wgGroupPermissions ===

The sysop group now holds the "autopatrol" and "ipblock-exempt" rights by
default.

"autopatrol" replaces the preference for marking ones own edits patrolled
by default; users holding this permission will automatically have their
edits patrolled, while others cannot mark their own edits as patrolled
even if they have patrolling rights.

"ipblock-exempt" excludes the user from IP blocks; accounts which are blocked
explicitly by name will still be blocked, however. This is given to sysops
to minimize annoyance from accidental "collateral damage"; remember that a
sysop will be able to lift the block if they desire.

The bot group now holds the "nominornewtalk" right. A user with this right
will not trigger new message notifications when making minor edits to user
talk pages. This is meant to minimize annoyance from maintenance bot
processes.

=== $wgUseWatchlistCache ===

Watchlist caching has been removed. The feature was not maintained, and has
been unnecessary since switching to the 'recentchanges' database table
reduced server pressure for Wikipedia's watchlists.

=== $wgBreakFrames ===

MediaWiki in the past attempted to detect when it was embedded in a frameset
and "break out" of it, assuming it to be hostile.

This behavior is now disabled by default, but can be reenabled by setting
$wgBreakFrames to true in LocalSettings.php.


== 1.8 New settings ==

=== $wgVariantArticlePath ===

For languages with script variant support (Chinese, Serbian, and others),
it's possible to use alternate URL paths to select the variant for article
display, setting $wgVariantArticlePath.

Documentation for this setting would be useful.

=== $wgMaxMsgCacheEntrySize ===

The message cache can now skip items larger than a given size; this allows
it to better handle the primary caching case when large CSS and JS blobs are
present.

=== $wgStyleVersion ===

When making significant changes to skin stylesheets and JavaScript files,
you can append a string to this variable to tweak the generated URLs,
forcing newly rendered pages to bring in a fresh version despite server-
or browser-side caching.

Normally this will be set in the course of MediaWiki development, but
if doing development on a custom skin you may wish to poke it as well.

=== $wgRCShowChangedSize ===

Special:Recentchanges and Special:Watchlist now show the number of bytes
added or removed to an article to give an idea of the size of the edit.
This information was previously available only in the IRC update feeds.

To disable this site-wide, set $wgRCShowChangedSize to false.
(Individual users can suppress the data in custom CSS.)

Adjust $wgRCChangedSizeThreshold to trigger highlighting of particularly
large changes.

The formatting of the size figure can be adjusted through the
[[MediaWiki:Rc-change-size]] message.

=== $wgQueryCacheLimit ===

The number of rows stored for "expensive" special pages in miser mode
can now be adjusted up or down from the default 1000.

=== $wgDisableQueryPageUpdate ===

Individual "expensive" special pages can be skipped in processing by
updateSpecialPages if added to this list.

=== $wgSorbsUrl ===

The base hostname for the DNS-based proxy blacklist can now be overridden
when $wgEnableSorbs is set, to use a different blacklist instead of SORBS.
The blacklist would need to respond the same was as SORBS; any positive
response will be taken as a proxy.

=== $wgAjaxWatch ===

Experimental AJAX mode for the watch/unwatch tabs to execute inline.
Does not include the UI messages describing how to reach the watchlist,
so you may not want it on a general-audience site just yet.

=== $wgParserTestFiles ===

MediaWiki's parser test suite can now be expanded with additional test
files. Custom extensions can add their test files to this array, and
they will be run along with the main tests by maintenance/parserTests.php


== Changes since 1.7 ==

* Introduced AjaxResponse object, superceding AjaxCachePolicy
* Changes to sajax_do_call: optionally accept an element to fill instead of a
  callback function; take the target function or element as a third parameter;
  pass the full XMLHttpRequest object to the handler function, instead of just
  the resultText value; use HTTP response codes to report errors.
* (bug 6562) Removed unmaintained ParserXml.php for now

  blocks. Fixed the problem of expiry and unblocking erroneously affecting
  multiple blocks. Fixed confusing lack of error message when a blocked user
  attempts to create an account. Fixed inefficiency of Special:Ipblocklist in 
  the presence of large numbers of blocks; added indexes and implemented an 
  indexed pager.

  the style of PHP's date(). Used string identifiers instead of integer
  identifiers, in both the language files and user preferences. Migration should
  be transparent in most cases.
* Simplified the initialisation API for LoadBalancer objects.

  regular sitenotice shows. If that doesn't exist, the value of $wgSiteNotice is used,
  and if that's null, then nothing is shown.

  to debugging issues. (Keep this?)
* Use __FILE__ to form path in new LocalSettings.php, so it stays accurate

  buggy and can make incorrect foldings in the query string and such, so isn't

----

== MediaWiki 1.5.8 ==

March 26, 2006

MediaWiki 1.5.8 is a security and bugfix maintenance release.

A bug in decoding of certain encoded links could allow injection of raw
HTML into page output; this could potentially lead to XSS attacks.

Some minor UI fixes were also made, see the change log at the bottom of
this file.


== MediaWiki 1.5.7 ==

March 2, 2006

MediaWiki 1.5.7 is a bugfix maintenance release.

Most importantly, a security issue in the installer has been fixed. The bug 
affects new installations of 1.5.6 only. If the user specified the MySQL root 
password, to allow the installer to create an unprivileged account, the 
installer would not only create the new account but also change the root 
password to be equal to the password of the new account. 

Anyone affected by this bug will need to change the root password back 
manually. For information about how to change passwords in MySQL please see:
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/passwords.html

This version includes fixes for compatibility with Internet Explorer 7
beta 2, and various other bugs; see the full changelog at the end of
the release notes.


== MediaWiki 1.5.6 ==

January 19, 2006

MediaWiki 1.5.6 is a security and bugfix maintenance release.

A bug in edit comment formatting could send PHP into an infinite loop
if certain malformed links were included. In most installations, this
would cause the script to fail after PHP's 30-second failsafe timeout.

Some improvements have been made to the installer which should make
installation possible on a system with a broken MySQL "root" account.

For several other minor fixes, see the complete changelog at the end
of this file.


== MediaWiki 1.5.5 ==

January 5, 2006

MediaWiki 1.5.5 is a security and bugfix maintenance release.

Detection for uploads of Windows Metafile (.wmf) images has been added
to help protect against a client-side vulnerability in unpatched Microsoft
Windows operating systems.

Sites which have enabled uploads and added non-standard file types
(such as .ogg, .doc, or .pdf) should upgrade to this release to ensure
that malicious .wmf files can't be uploaded with a fake extension;
such files could put visitors to the site at risk.

For more details on this, see:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Metafile_vulnerability

Additionally, a maintenance script removeUnusedAccounts.php has been added;
this replaces an older Perl script which had not been updated for the new
schema in 1.5.


== MediaWiki 1.5.4 ==

December 21, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5.4 is a security and bugfix maintenance release.

A hardcoded internal placeholder string has been replaced with a random
one. This closes a hole where security checks in inline style attributes
could be bypassed, injecting JavaScript code that could execute in
Microsoft Internet Explorer.

Other browsers would not be vulnerable.

Several minor fixes are included in this release, most notably a fix
to clear the "you have new messages" flag properly for usernames
containing spaces when e-mail notification is enabled.

See the changelog at the end of the release notes for a full list of
fixes.


== MediaWiki 1.5.3 ==

December 4, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5.3 is a security and bugfix maintenance release.

Validation of the user language option was broken by a code change in
May 2005, opening the possibility of remote code execution as this
parameter is used in forming a class name dynamically created with
eval().

The validation has been corrected in this version. All prior 1.5 release
and prelease versions are affected; 1.4 and earlier and not affected.

Additionally several bugs have been fixed; see the changelog later in
this file for a complete list.


== MediaWiki 1.5.2 ==

November 2, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5.2 is a bugfix maintenance release.

A change in PHP 4.4.1 and PHP 5.1.0RC broke handling of extension and
<pre> sections, causing garbage data to be inserted in output and saved
edits. This version works around the change.

Several other glitches with MySQL 5.0 and PHP 5.0.5 were also fixed;
see the change log below for a complete list.


== MediaWiki 1.5.1 ==

October 26, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5.1 is a bugfix and security maintenance release, and is a
recommended upgrade for all installations.

This release includes further corrections to the inline CSS style sanitation
which works around a JavaScript "feature" on Microsoft Internet Explorer.
Users of Microsoft Internet Explorer for Windows may be vulnerable to
XSS injections on prior versions; users of standards-compliant browsers
are not vulnerable.

Major fixes include:
* Image pages work again with resizing disabled
* Works in MySQL 5.0 strict mode

There is experimental support in this release for explicitly declaring
the UTF-8 charset in the database; this has been tested with MySQL 5.0.15
but should work on 4.1 as well.

IMPORTANT: Changing this setting on an existing wiki may produce interesting
data corruption, depending on server configuration. Page contents should,
usually, be unaffected, but page titles and other items may be. Limitations
in MySQL's Unicode support mean that characters outside the BMP cannot be used
in page titles or various other fields when using this mode.

Table definitions are in maintenance/mysql5/tables.sql, and the runtime
option to send 'SET NAMES utf8' is set by $wgDBmysql5 = true.

(MySQL 3.23.x and 4.0.x do not support character set declarations; on these
versions MediaWiki simply works with UTF-8 data and MySQL is blissfully
unaware of it.)



== MediaWiki 1.5.0 final ==

October 5, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5.0 is the new stable release branch of MediaWiki, and is
recommended for all new installations.

Any wikis running a 1.5 beta or release candidate are strongly recommended
to upgrade to the final release, which includes a number of bug fixes and
a security fix for CSS bugs in Microsoft Internet Explorer.

IMPORTANT: Running a 1.3 or 1.4 wiki and don't want to jump to 1.5 yet?
Be sure to upgrade to 1.3.17 or 1.4.11, also released today. Versions
prior to 1.3.16 and 1.4.10 have a serious data corruption bug which is
triggered by a spambot known to operate in the wild.


=== What's new in 1.5? ===

Schema:
  The core table schema has changed significantly. This should make better
  use of the database's cache and disk I/O, and make significantly speed up
  rename and delete operations on pages with very long edit histories.
  
  Unfortunately this does mean upgrading a wiki of size from 1.4 will require
  some downtime for the schema restructuring, but future storage backend
  changes should be able to integrate into the new system more easily.

Permalinks:
  The current revision of a page now has a permanent 'oldid' number assigned
  immediately, and the id numbers are now preserved across deletion/undeletion.
  A permanent reference to the current revision of a page is now just a matter
  of going to the 'history' tab and copying the first link in the list.

Page move log:
  Renames of pages are now recorded in Special:Log and the page history.
  A handy revert link is available from the log for sysops.

Editing diff:
  Ever lost track of what you'd done so far during an edit? A 'Show diff'
  button on the edit page now makes it easy to remember.

Uploads:
  It's now possible to specify the final filename of an upload distinct
  from the original filename on your disk.
  
  An image link for a missing file will now take you straight to the upload page.
  
  More metadata is pre-extracted from uploaded images, which will ease pressure
  on disk or NFS volumes used to store images. EXIF metadata is displayed on
  the image description page if PHP is configured with the necessary module.
  
  If .svg files are added to the upload whitelist, you can choose to render
  them to rasterized .png images for inline display using one of several
  external helper programs. See DefaultSettings.php for SVG options.

User accounts:
  There are some changes to the user permissions system, with assignable
  groups. Note that this does *not* allow you to make pages which are only
  accessible to certain groups.

E-mail:
  User-to-user e-mail can now be restricted to require a mail-back confirmation
  first to reduce potential for abuse with false addresses.
  
  Updates to user talk pages and watchlist entries can optionally send e-mail
  notifications.

External hooks:
  A somewhat experimental interface for hooking in an external editor
  application is included.

And...
  A bunch of stuff we forgot to mention.


=== What's gone? ===

Latin-1:
  Wikis must now be encoded in Unicode UTF-8; this has been the default for
  some time, but some languages could optionally be installed in Latin-1 mode.
  This is no longer supported.
  
  You can check if your current wiki is in Latin-1 mode by using your browser's
  "view source"; look for a line like this:
  
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
  
  If it says charset=utf-8, you're ready. If it says charset=iso8859-1,
  you may need to convert your data. (English-language wikis avoiding
  any accented characters may be able to get away without conversion.)

MySQL 3.x:
  Some optimization hacks for MySQL 3.x have been removed as part of the schema
  clean-up (specifically, the inverse_timestamp fields).
  
  MediaWiki 1.5 may still run on 3.x, but wikis of non-trivial size should
  very seriously consider upgrading to a more modern release. MySQL 3.x support
  will probably be entirely dropped in the next major release.

Special:Maintenance
  These tools were, ironically enough, not really maintained. This special
  page has been removed; insofar as some of its pieces were useful and haven't
  already been supplanted by other special pages they should be rewritten in
  an efficient and safe manner in the future.


=== Caveats ===

Upgrade:
  Wikis in Latin-1 encoding are no longer supported; only Unicode UTF-8.
  A new option $wgLegacyEncoding is provided to allow on-the-fly recoding of
  old page text entries, but other metadata fields (titles, comments etc) need
  to be pre-converted. The standard upgrade process does not yet fully automate
  this, but you can try the alternate partial-upgrader in upgrade1_5.php.
  
  The upgrade from 1.4 to 1.5 schema has not been tested for all cases, so
  it's possible you may experience problems in some combinations.

Backups:
  The text entries of deleted pages are no longer removed from the main
  text table on deletion. If you provide public backup dumps of your databases,
  you will probably want to use the new XML-format dump generator, available
  as maintenance/dumpBackup.php.
  
  For more information on how we run our own public data dumps at Wikimedia,
  see http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Data_dumps

PostgreSQL:
  The table definitions for PostgreSQL install are out of date. PostgreSQL
  support may return in later releases, pending appropriate patches.

MySQL 4.1+:
  Some users may encounter installation problems with MySQL 4.1 or higher
  due to strange charset encoding / collation configurations. Try setting
  to 'latin1' or 'utf8' if you encounter problems.



== MediaWiki 1.5 release candidate 4 ==

August 29, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5rc4 is a preview release of the new 1.5 release series.
It fixes compatibility with PHP 5.1, and corrects two cross-site scripting
security bugs:

* <math> tags were handled incorrectly when TeX rendering support is off,
  as in the default configuration.
* Extension or <nowiki> sections in Wiki table syntax could bypass HTML
  style attribute restrictions for cross-site scripting attacks against
  Microsoft Internet Explorer

Wikis where the optional math support has been *enabled* are not vulnerable
to the first, but are vulnerable to the second.



== MediaWiki 1.5 release candidate 3 ==

August 24, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5rc3 is a preview release of the new 1.5 release series.
It fixes several major problems in 1.5rc2:

* Fixed a cross-site scripting injection in the search form
  (broken since 1.5beta1)

* Fixed upgrades from 1.4 database schema
  (broken since 1.5rc2)

1.3 and 1.4 releases are not vulnerable to the XSS bug, but anyone
running an earlier 1.5 beta or release candidate should upgrade
immediately.


== MediaWiki 1.5 release candidate 2 ==

August 23, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5rc2 is a preview release of the new 1.5 release series.
Numerous bug fixes since last beta, plus a security fix; see change
log below for full details.

A flaw in the interaction between extensions and HTML attribute
sanitization was discovered which could allow unauthorized use
of offsite resources in style sheets, and possible exploitation
of a JavaScript injection feature on Microsoft Internet Explorer.

This version expands the returned text and properly checks it
before output.

A 1.5rc1 release was mistakenly made from the incorrect source code
branch; 1.5rc2 is identical to the actual 1.5rc1 in revision control
except for version number.


== MediaWiki 1.5 beta 4 ==

July 30, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5 beta 4 is a preview release of the new 1.5 release series.
A number of bugs have been fixed since beta 3; see the full changelist below.


== MediaWiki 1.5 beta 3 ==

July 7, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5 beta 3 is a preview release of the new 1.5 release
series, with a security update over beta 2.

Incorrect escaping of a parameter in the page move template could
be used to inject JavaScript code by getting a victim to visit a
maliciously constructed URL. Users of vulnerable releases are
recommended to upgrade to this release.

Vulnerable versions:
* 1.5 preview series: n <= 1.5beta2 vulnerable, fixed in 1.5beta3
* 1.4 stable series: 1.4beta6 <= n <= 1.4.5 vulnerable, fixed in 1.4.6
* 1.3 legacy series: not vulnerable

This release also includes several bug fixes and localization updates.
See the changelog at the end of this file for a detailed list.



== MediaWiki 1.5 beta 2 ==

July 5, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5 beta 2 is a preview release of the new 1.5 release series.
While most exciting new bugs should have been ironed out at this point,
third-party wiki operators should probably not run this beta release
on a public site without closely following additional development.

Anyone who _has_ been running beta 1 is very very strongly advised to
upgrade to beta 2, as it fixes many bugs from the previous beta including
a couple of HTML and SQL injections.

This release should be followed by one or two release candidates and
a 1.5.0 final within the next few weeks.

Beta upgraders, note there are some minor database changes. For upgrades
from 1.4, see the file UPGRADE for details on significant database and
configuration file changes.

Beta 2 includes a preliminary command-line XML wiki dump importer tool,
maintenance/importDump.php, paired with maintenance/dumpBackup.php.
These use the same format as Special:Export and Special:Import, able
to package a wiki's entire page set independent of the backend database
and compression format.


== MediaWiki 1.5 beta 1 ==

June 26, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5 beta 1 is a preview release, pretty much feature complete,
of the new 1.5 release series. There are several known and likely a number
of unknown bugs; it is not recommended to use this release in a production
environment but would be recommended for testing in mind of an upcoming
deployment.

A number of significant changes have been made since the alpha releases,
including database changes and a reworking of the user permissions settings.
See the file UPGRADE for details of upgrading and changing your prior
configuration settings for the new system.



== MediaWiki 1.5 alpha 2 ==

June 3, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5 alpha 2 includes a lot of bug fixes, feature merges,
and a security update.

Incorrect handling of page template inclusions made it possible to
inject JavaScript code into HTML attributes, which could lead to
cross-site scripting attacks on a publicly editable wiki.

Vulnerable releases and fix:
* 1.5 prerelease: fixed in 1.5alpha2
* 1.4 stable series: fixed in 1.4.5
* 1.3 legacy series: fixed in 1.3.13
* 1.2 series no longer supported; upgrade to 1.4.5 strongly recommended


== MediaWiki 1.5 alpha 1 ==

May 3, 2005

This is a testing preview release, being put out mainly to aid testers in
finding installation bugs and other major problems. It is strongly recommended
NOT to run a live production web site on this alpha release.

**  WARNING: USE OF THIS ALPHA RELEASE MAY INFEST YOUR HOUSE WITH  **
**  TERMITES, ROT YOUR TEETH,  GROW HAIR ON YOUR PALMS, AND PASTE  **
**  INNUENDO  INTO  YOUR  C.V.  RIGHT  BEFORE  A  JOB  INTERVIEW!  **
**  DON'T SAY WE DIDN'T WARN YOU, MAN. WE TOTALLY DID RIGHT HERE.  **

produce 100% valid or well-formed XHTML output. Testers are welcome to
set $wgMimeType = "application/xhtml+xml"; to test for remaining problem
cases, but this is not recommended on live sites. (This must be set for
MathML to display properly in Mozilla.)

== MediaWiki 1.4.3 ==

(released 2005-04-28)

MediaWiki 1.4.3 is a bugfix release for the 1.4 stable release series.

Chiefly, this fixes a compatibility problem with PHP 5 and a minor link
table corruption bug on initial page save.


== MediaWiki 1.4.2 ==

(released 2005-04-20)

MediaWiki 1.4.2 is a security and bug fix release for the 1.4 stable release
series.

A cross-site scripting injection vulnerability was discovered, which
affects only MSIE clients and is only open if MediaWiki has been
manually configured to run output through HTML Tidy ($wgUseTidy).

Several other bugs are fixed in this release, see the changelog below.

All new installations are highly recommended to use 1.4.2 instead of
1.3.x; 1.3.x users should consider upgrading for bug fixes and new
features. Ealier 1.4.x release and beta users should upgrade to this
release for relevant bug fixes; see the changelog later in this file.


If you have trouble, remember to read this whole file and the online FAQ page
before asking for help:

http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki_FAQ


=== READ THIS FIRST: Upgrading ===

If upgrading from an older release, see the notes in the file UPGRADE.
There are a couple of minor database changes from the beta releases,
and somewhat larger changes from 1.3.x.

Upgrading from a previous 1.4.x stable release installation should
generally only require copying the new files over the old ones.


==== READ THIS FIRST, TOO: MySQL 4.1 AND 5.0 ====

MySQL 5.0 is a beta release, not yet ready for production use. If you
are using it, the notes below about 4.1 apply to you too.

If you have the choice of MySQL 4.0 or MySQL 4.1 and don't need 4.1 for
some other application, you should consider sticking with 4.0 for the
moment. 4.1 may require you to do extra fiddling to get things to work
due to changes that aren't fully backwards-compatible.

MySQL 4.1 has changed the authentication protocol in an incompatible
way; many PHP installations still use the older client libraries and
CANNOT CONNECT TO THE SERVER WITH A PASSWORD without some changes.

See: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/Old_client.html

If MySQL is set with utf-8 as the default character set, installation
may fail with "key too long" errors. Set the default charset to 'latin1'
for installation and it should work.

The mysqldump backup generator now applies an automatic conversion to
UTF-8, which may irretrivably corrupt your data. Pass the -charset option
with the original default charset (eg 'latin1') to skip the conversion.


==== READ THIS FIRST IF RUNNING ON A WINDOWS SERVER ====

MediaWiki is tested and deployed primarily under the Apache web server
on Linux Unix systems. There are known to be problems running on
Microsoft's IIS which are not fully resolved. If you have a choice,
try running under Apache on Windows, or on a Unix/Linux box instead.

If you're having trouble with blank pages on IIS and can't switch,
try the workaround suggested in this bug report:
http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1763


=== New features ===

* 'Recentchanges Patrol' to mark new edits that haven't yet been viewed.
* New, searchable deletion/upload/protection logs
* Image gallery generation (Special:Newimages and <gallery> tag)
* SVG rasterization support (requires external support tools)
* Users can select from the available localizations to override the
  default user interface language.
* Traditional/Simplified Chinese conversion support
* rel="nofollow" support to combat linkspam

The current implementation adds this attribute to _all_ external URL
links in wiki text (but not internal [[wiki links]] or interwiki links).
To disable the attribute for _all_ external links, add this line to your
LocalSettings.php:

  $wgNoFollowLinks = false

For background information on nofollow see:

  http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html


=== Installation and compatibility ===

* The default MonoBook theme now works with PHP 5.0
* Installation on systems with PHP's safe mode or other oddities
  should work more reliably, as MonoBook no longer needs to
  create a compiled template file for the wiki to run.
* A table prefix may be specified, to avoid conflicts with other
  web applications forced to share a database.
* More thorough UTF-8 input validation; fixes non-ASCII uploaded
  filenames from Safari.
* Command-line database upgrade script.


=== Customizability ===

* Default user options can now be overridden in LocalSettings.
* Skins system more modular: templates and CSS are now in /skins/
  New skins can be dropped into this directory and used immediately.
* More extension hooks have been added.
* Authentication plugin hook.
* More internal code documentation, generated with phpdoc:
  http://www.mediawiki.org/docs/html/


=== Optimization ===

* For many operations, MediaWiki 1.4 should run faster and use
  less memory than MediaWiki 1.3. Page rendering is up to twice
  as fast. (Use a PHP accelerator such as Turck MMCache for best
  results with any PHP application, though!)
* The parser cache no longer requires memcached, and is enabled
  by default. This avoids a lot of re-rendering of pages that
  have been shown recently, greatly speeding longer page views.
* Support for compiled PHP modules to speed up page diff and
  Unicode validation/normalization. (Requires ability to compile
  and load PHP extensions).


=== What isn't ready yet ===

* A new user/groups permissions scheme has been held back to 1.5.
* An experimental SOAP interface will be made available as an extension
* PostgreSQL support is largely working, minus search and the installer.
  You can perform a manual installation.
* E-mail notification of watched page changes and verification of
  user-submitted e-mail addresses is not yet included.
* Log pages are not automatically imported into the new log table
  at upgrade time. A script to import old text log entries is
  incomplete, but may be available in later point releases.
* Some localizations are still incomplete.



== Changelog ==

=== Important security updates ===

A security audit found and fixed a number of problems. Users of MediaWiki
1.3.10 and earlier should upgrade to 1.3.11; users of 1.4 beta releases
prior to 1.4rc1 should upgrade immediately.

==== Cross-site scripting vulnerability ====

XSS injection points can be used to hijack session and authentication
cookies as well as more serious attacks.

* Media: links output raw text into an attribute value, potentially
  abusable for JavaScript injection. This has been corrected.
* Additional checks added to file upload to protect against MSIE and
  Safari MIME-type autodetection bugs.

As of 1.3.10/1.4beta6, per-user customized CSS and JavaScript is disabled
by default as a general precaution. Sites which want this ability may set
$wgAllowUserCss and $wgAllowUserJs in LocalSettings.php.


==== Cross-site request forgery ====

An attacker could use JavaScript-submitted forms to perform various
restricted actions by tricking an authenticated user into visiting
a malicious web page. A fix for page editing in 1.3.10/1.4beta6 has
been expanded in this release to other forms and functions.

Authors of bot tools may need to update their code to include the
additional fields.


==== Directory traversal ====

An unchecked parameter in image deletion could allow an authenticated
administrator to delete arbitary files in directories writable by the
web server, and confirm existence of files not deletable.


==== Older issues ====

Note that 1.4 beta releases prior to beta 5 include an input validation
error which could lead to execution of arbitrary PHP code on the server.
Users of older betas should upgrade immediately to the current version.


Beta 6 also introduces the use of rel="nofollow" attributes on external
links in wiki pages to reduce the effectiveness of wiki spam. This will
cause participating search engines to ignore external URL links from wiki
pages for purposes of page relevancy ranking.

=== Caveats ===

Some output, particularly involving user-supplied inline HTML, may not
produce 100% valid or well-formed XHTML output. Testers are welcome to
set $wgMimeType = "application/xhtml+xml"; to test for remaining problem
cases, but this is not recommended on live sites. (This must be set for
MathML to display properly in Mozilla.)
