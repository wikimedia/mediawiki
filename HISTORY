=== Changes since 1.22.9 ===
* (bug 64970) Fix support for blobs on DatabaseOracle::update
* (bug 60719) In MediaWiki 1.22, the job queue execution on each page request was changed (Gerrit change 59797) so, instead of executing the job inside the same PHP process that's rendering the page, a new PHP cli command is spawned to execute runJobs.php in the background. It will only work if $wgPhpCli is set to an actual path or safe mode is off, otherwise, the old method will be used. https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Job_queue#Changes_introduced_in_MediaWiki_1.22 for more infomation. This change was in earlier releases of 1.22 but was not noted here until now.

== MediaWiki 1.22.9 ==
This is a security and maintenance release of the MediaWiki 1.22 branch.

=== Changes since 1.22.8 ===
* (bug 68187) SECURITY: Prepend jsonp callback with comment.

=== Changes since 1.22.6 ===
* (bug 65501) SECURITY: Don't parse usernames as wikitext on Special:PasswordReset.
* (bug 36356) Add space between two feed links.
* (bug 63269) Email notifications were not correctly handling the MediaWiki:Helppage message being set to a full URL. This is a regression from the 1.22.5 point release, which made the default value for it a URL. If you customized MediaWiki:Enotif body (the text of email notifications), you'll need to edit it locally to include the URL via the new variable $HELPPAGE instead of the parser functions fullurl and canonicalurl; otherwise you don't have to do anything.
Add missing uploadstash.us_props for PostgreSQL.

The link now points to a mediawiki.org page which is guaranteed to exist. Nothing needs to be done on your end, but remember to adjust MediaWiki:Sidebar for the needs of your wikis. Everyone can help with the shared documentation by translating: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:Translate/agg-Help_pages .
* (bug 53888) Corrected a regression in 1.22 which introduced red links on the login page. If you previously installed 1.22.x and have created a local page to make the red link blue, write its title as in MediaWiki:helplogin-url if you didn't already. Otherwise, you don't need to do anything, but you can translate the help page at https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Logging_in .

The PHP parser and evaluator as well as the JavaScript evaluator were updated to support the new format. Plural rules for some languages have changed, most notably Russian. Affected software messages have been updated and marked for review at translatewiki.net. This change is backported from the development branch of MediaWiki 1.23.
* (bug 58434) The broken installer for database backend Oracle was fixed.
* (bug 58167) The web installer no longer throws an exception when PHP is compiled without support for MySQL yet with support for another DBMS.

=== Configuration changes in 1.22 ===
* $wgRedirectScript was removed. It was unused.
* Removed $wgLocalMessageCacheSerialized, it is now always true.
* $wgVectorUseIconWatch is now enabled by default.
* $wgCascadingRestrictionLevels was added.
* ftps, ssh, sftp, xmpp, sip, sips, tel, sms, bitcoin, magnet, urn, and geo
  have been whitelisted inside of $wgUrlProtocols.
* $wgDocType and $wgDTD have been removed and are no longer used for the DOCTYPE.
* $wgHtml5 is no longer used by core. Setting it to false will no longer disable HTML5.
  It is still set to true for extension compatibility but doing so in extensions is deprecated.
* $wgXhtmlDefaultNamespace is no longer used by core. Setting it will no longer change the
  xmlns used by MediaWiki. Reliance on this variable by extensions is deprecated.
* $wgHandheldStyle was removed.
* $wgHandheldForIPhone was removed.
* $wgJsMimeType is no longer used by core. Most usage has been removed since
  HTML output is now exclusively HTML5.
* $wgDBOracleDRCP added. True enables persistent connection with DRCP on Oracle.
* $wgLogAutopatrol added to allow disabling logging of autopatrol edits in the logging table.
  default for $wgLogAutopatrol is true.
* The 'edit' right no longer allows for editing a user's own CSS and JS.
* New rights 'editmyusercss', 'editmyuserjs', 'viewmywatchlist',
  'editmywatchlist', 'viewmyprivateinfo', 'editmyprivateinfo', and
  'editmyoptions' restrict actions that were formerly allowed by default. They
  have been added to the default for $wgGroupPermissions['*'].
* The 'editprotected' right no longer allows bypassing of all page protection
  restrictions. Any group using it for this purpose will now need to have all
  the individual rights listed in $wgRestrictionTypes for the same effect.
* The 'protect' and 'autoconfirmed' rights are no longer used for the default
  page protection levels. The rights 'editprotected' and 'editsemiprotected'
  are now used for this purpose instead.
* (bug 40866) wgOldChangeTagsIndex removed.
* $wgNoFollowDomainExceptions now only matches entire domains. For example,
  an entry for 'bar.com' will still match 'foo.bar.com' but not 'foobar.com'.
* $wgCopyUploadTimeout and $wgCopyUploadAsyncTimeout added to change the timeout times for
  fetching the file during upload by url.
* New key added to $wgGalleryOptions - $wgGalleryOptions['mode'] to set
  default gallery mode.
* New hook 'GalleryGetModes' to allow extensions to make new gallery modes.
* The checkbox for staying in HTTPS displayed on the login form when $wgSecureLogin is
  enabled has been removed. Instead, whether the user stays in HTTPS will be determined
  based on the user's preferences, and whether they came from HTTPS or not.
* $wgRC2UDPAddress, $wgRC2UDPInterwikiPrefix, $wgRC2UDPOmitBots, $wgRC2UDPPort,
  and $wgRC2UDPPrefix configuration options have been deprecated in favor of a
  $wgRCFeeds configuration array. $wgRCFeeds makes both the format and
  destination of recent change notifications customizable, and allows for
  multiple destinations to be specified.
* (bug 53862) portal-url, currentevents-url and helppage have been removed from the
  default Sidebar.
* The 'vector-simplesearch' preference is now enabled by default. Previously
  it was only enabled if the Vector extension was installed.
* The precise format of metric datagrams produced by the UDP profiler and stats counter
  may now be specified as $wgUDPProfilerFormatString and $wgStatsFormatString,
  respectively.
* (bug 54597) $wgBlockOpenProxies, $wgProxyPorts, $wgProxyScriptPath, and
  $wgProxyMemcExpiry have been removed, along with the open proxy scanner
  script they were added for.
* Default value of $wgMaxShellMemory has been tripled (it's now 300 MB).

=== New features in 1.22 ===
* You can now install extensions using Composer.
  See https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Composer
* (bug 44525) mediawiki.jqueryMsg can now parse (whitelisted) HTML elements and attributes.
* (bug 33454) Language::sprintfDate now has a timezone parameter, and supports
  the "eIOPTZ" formatting characters.
* EditWarning: A warning is shown when an editor leaves the edit form without
  saving (enabled by default, users can opt-out via the 'useeditwarning'
  preference). This feature was moved from the Vector extension, and is now part
  of core for all skins. Take care when upgrading that you don't use an older
  version of the Vector extension as this feature may conflict.
* New 'mediawiki.ui' CSS module providing mw-ui-* styles for buttons and a
  compact vertical form layout.
* HTMLForm supports a new display format 'vform' which applies this compact vertical
  layout and button styling. Special:PasswordReset uses this format.
* New versions of login (Special:UserLogin) and create account
  (Special:UserLogin/signup) forms using the "vform" compact vertical form layout.
  These forms use new messages that assume a "Help logging in" link, see
  https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Page_customizations;
  https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Account_creation_user_experience/Strings lists the
  message key changes.
* (bug 23343) Implemented ability to apply IP blocks to the contents of X-Forwarded-For headers
  by adding a new configuration variable $wgApplyIpBlocksToXff (disabled by default).
* The new hook 'APIGetPossibleErrors' to modify the list of possible errors was
  added.
* (bug 25592) LogEventsList::showLogExtract() will now ignore various
  Pager-related WebRequest parameters by default, as this is overwhelmingly
  likely to be what was intended by users of the method. If any caller wishes
  to use these parameters, the new param 'useRequestParams' may be set to true.
* mw.util.addPortletLink: Tooltip is no longer required to be plain (without
  an accesskey in it already). As such it now rountrips. Creating a link with a
  message as tooltip, grabbing the title attribute and using it to create
  another portlet will work as expected.
* (bug 6747) {{ROOTPAGENAME}} introduced, contains the name of the topmost
  page without namespace.
* BREAKING CHANGE: (bug 41729) Display editsection links next to headings. Also
  change their class name from .editsection to .mw-editsection and place them at
  the end of the heading element instead of the beginning. Client-side code and
  screen-scrapers will have to be adjusted to handle both cases (old HTML will
  still be visible on cached page renders until they are purged); extensions
  using the DoEditSectionLink or EditSectionLink hooks might need adjustments as
  well.
* (bug 45535) introduced the new 'LanguageLinks' hook for manipulating the
  language links associated with a page before display.
* Chosen (http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/) was added as module 'jquery.chosen'
* HTMLForm will turn multiselect checkboxes into a Chosen interface when setting cssclass 'mw-chosen'
* rebuildLocalisationCache learned --lang option. Let you rebuild l10n caches
  of the specified languages instead of all of them.
* New GetNewMessagesAlert hook allowing extensions to disable or modify the new
  messages alert
* New wgUserNewMsgRevisionId JS global for logged in users. This will be null
  if the user has no new talk page messages. Otherwise it will be set to the
  revision ID of the oldest new talk page message. This will allow gadgets and
  extensions to create their own new message alerts on the client side.
* mediawiki.log: Added log.warn wrapper (uses console.warn and console.trace).
* mediawiki.log: Implemented log.deprecate. This method defines a property and
  uses ES5 getter/setter to emit a warning when they are used.
* $wgCascadingRestrictionLevels was added, allowing one to specify restriction levels
  which can be cascading (previously 'sysop' was hard-coded as the only one).
* XHTML5 support has been improved. If you set $wgMimeType = 'application/xhtml+xml'
  MediaWiki will try outputting markup acording to XHTML5 rules.
* Altered hook 'ProtectionForm::save', adding the reason page protection is
  changed as third parameter.
* New hook 'TitleSquidURLs' for manipulating the list of URLs to be purged from
  HTTP caches when a page is changed.
* Changed the patrolling system to always show the link for patrolling in case the
  current revision is patrollable. This also removed the usage of the rcid URI parameters.
* Oracle DB backend now supports Database Resident Connection Pooling (DRCP).
  Can be enabled by setting $wgDBOracleDRCP=true.
  Requires Oracle DB 11gR1 or above, enabled DRCP inside the DB itself and a
  propper connect string.
  More about DRCP can be found at:
  http://www.oracle-base.com/articles/11g/database-resident-connection-pool-11gr1.php
* Add a new parameter $patrolFooterShown to hook ArticleViewFooter so the hook
  handlers can take further action based on the status of the patrol footer
* A new hook TitleQuickPermissions was added to allow overriding of quick
  permissions in the Title class.
* LinkCache singleton can now be altered or cleared, letting one to specify
  another instance that does not rely on a database backend.
* MediaWiki's PHPUnit tests can now use PHPUnit installed using composer --dev.
* (bug 43689) The lists of templates used on the page and hidden categories it
  is a member of, shown below the edit form, are now collapsible (and collapsed
  by default).
* Parser profiling data, formerly only available in the "NewPP limit report"
  HTML comment, is now also displayed at the bottom of page previews.
* Added ParserLimitReportPrepare and ParserLimitReportFormat hooks, deprecated
  ParserLimitReport hook.
* New user rights have been added to increase granularity in rights management
  for extensions such as OAuth:
** editmyusercss controls whether a user may edit their own CSS subpages.
** editmyuserjs controls whether a user may edit their own JS subpages.
** viewmywatchlist controls whether a user may view their watchlist.
** editmywatchlist controls whether a user may edit their watchlist.
** viewmyprivateinfo controls whether a user may access their private
   information (e.g. registered email address, real name).
** editmyprivateinfo controls whether a user may change their private
   information.
** editmyoptions controls whether a user may change their preferences.
* Add new hook AbortTalkPageEmailNotification, this will be used to determine
  whether to send the regular talk page email notification
* Action classes registered in $wgActions are now also supported in the form of
  a callback (which returns an instance of Action) instead of providing the name
  of a subclass of Action.
* (bug 46513) Vector: Add the collapsibleTabs script from the Vector extension.
* Added $wgRecentChangesFlags for defining new flags for RecentChanges and
  watchlists.
* (bug 40518) mw.toolbar: Implemented mw.toolbar.addButtons for adding multiple
 button objects in one call.
* Rights used for the default protection levels ('sysop' and 'autoconfirmed')
  are now used just for that purpose, instead of overloading other rights. This
  allows easy granting of the ability to edit sysop-protected pages without
  also granting the ability to protect and unprotect.
* (bug 48256) Make brackets in section edit links accessible to CSS.
  They are now wrapped in <span class="mw-editsection-bracket" />.
* (bug 8480) Allow handler specific parameters in galleries (like page number)
* jquery.client: Add detection for Opera 15 and Internet Explorer 11.
* Change tags (used by the AbuseFilter extension) are now shown on diff pages.
* Change tag lists (shown on recent changes, watchlist, user contributions,
  history pages, diff pages) now include a link to Special:Tags to distinguish
  them from edit summaries.
* Added a new method and hook, User::isEveryoneAllowed() and
  UserIsEveryoneAllowed, for use in situations where a "does everyone have this
  right?" check is used to avoid more expensive checks.
* (bug 14431) Display "(No difference)" instead of an empty diff (when comparing
  revisions in the history or when previewing changes while editing).
* New hook 'IsUploadAllowedFromUrl' is added which can be used to intercept uploads by
  URL, useful for blacklisting specific URLs
* (bug 21912) Watchlist token implementation has been refactored and
  Special:ResetTokens was added to allow users to reset their tokens
  instead of presenting them in Preferences.
* Special:PrefixIndex now lets you strip the searched prefix from the displayed
  titles. Given a list of articles named Bug1, Bug2, you can now transclude the
  list of bug numbers using: {{Special:PrefixIndex/Bug|stripprefix=1}}.
  The special page form received a new checkbox matching that option.
* (bug 23580) Implement javascript callback interface "mw.hook".
* (bug 30713) New mw.hook "wikipage.content".
* (bug 40430) jquery.placeholder gets a new parameter to set the attribute value
  to be used.
* $wgHTCPMulticastRouting renamed $wgHTCPRouting since it accepts unicast.
* $wgHTCPRouting rules can now be passed an array of hosts/ports to send purge
  too. Can be used whenever several multicast group could be interested by a
  specific purge.
* (bug 25931) Add Special:RandomInCategory.
* mediawiki.util: addPortletLink now supports passing a jQuery object as nextnode.
* <wbr> can now be used inside WikiText.
* WebResponse::setcookie is much more featureful. Callers using PHP's
  setcookie() or setrawcookie() should begin using this instead.
* New hook WebResponseSetCookie, called from WebResponse::setcookie().
* New hook ResetSessionID, called when the session id is reset.
* Add a mode parameter to <gallery> tag with potential options of "traditional",
  "nolines", "packed", "packed-overlay", or "packed-hover".
* (bug 47399) A success message is now displayed after changing the password.
* Make thumb.php give HTTP redirects for file redirects
* (bug 30607) Special:ListFiles can now show old versions of files. Additionally
  Special:AllMyUploads was introduced so the user can get a list of all things
  they have ever uploaded, even if it was subsequently overriden.
* Introduced Special:MyFiles and Special:AllMyFiles as an alias for Special:MyUploads
  and Special:AllMyUploads respectively.
* IPv6 addresses in X-Forwarded-For headers are now normalised before checking
  against allowed proxy lists.
* Add deferrable update support for callback/closure.
* Add TitleMove hook before page renames.
* Revision deletion backend code is moved out of SpecialRevisiondelete
* Added {{REVISIONSIZE}} variable to get the current size of a revision.
* Add support for the LESS stylesheet language to ResourceLoader. LESS is a
  stylesheet language that compiles into CSS. ResourceLoader file modules may
  include LESS style files; ResourceLoader will compile these files into CSS
  before sending them to the client.
** The $wgResourceLoaderLESSVars configuration variable is an associative array
   mapping variable names to string CSS values. These variables are considered
   declared for all LESS files. Additional variables may be registered by
   adding keys to the array.
** $wgResourceLoaderLESSFunctions is an associative array of custom LESS
   function names to PHP callables. See <http://leafo.net/lessphp/docs/#custom_functions>
   for more details regarding custom functions.
** $wgResourceLoaderLESSImportPaths is an array of file system paths. Files
   referenced in LESS '@import' statements are looked up here first.
* ResourceLoader supports hashes as module cache invalidation trigger (instead
  of or in addition to timestamps).
* Added $wgExtensionEntryPointListFiles for use in mergeMessageFileList.php.
* Added a hook, APIQuerySiteInfoStatisticsInfo, to allow extensions to modify
  the output of the API query meta=siteinfo&siprop=statistics
* Primary keys have been added to both the archive table and the externallinks
  tables.
* Added $wgEnableParserLimitReporting to control whether the NewPP limit report is
  output in a HTML comment.
* The 'UnwatchArticle' and 'WatchArticle' hooks now support a Status object
  instead of just a boolean return value to abort the hook.
* Added a hook, SpecialWatchlistGetNonRevisionTypes, to allow extensions
  with custom recentchanges entries to hook into the Watchlist without
  clobbering each other.
* A hidden, empty input field was added to the edit form, and any edit that fills
  it in will be rejected. This prevents against the simplest form of spambots.
  Previously in the "SimpleAntiSpam" extension by Ryan Schmidt.
* populateRevisionLength.php maintenance script updated to also populate
  archive.ar_len field.
* (bug 43571) DatabaseMySQLBase learned to list views, optionally filtered by a
  prefix. Also fixed PHPUnit test suite when using a MySQL backend containing
  views.

=== Bug fixes in 1.22 ===
* (bug 47271) $wgContentHandlerUseDB should be set to false during the upgrade
* Disable Special:PasswordReset when $wgEnableEmail is false. Previously one
  could still navigate to the page by entering the URL directly.
* (bug 47138) Fixed a fatal error when a blocked user tries to automatically
  create an account on login due external authentication in some circumstances.
* (bug 23393) HTML <hN> headings containing line breaks are now handled
  correctly.
* (bug 45803) Whitespace within == Headline == syntax and within <hN> headings
  is now non-significant and not preserved in the HTML output.
* (bug 47218) Special:BlockList now handles correctly user names with spaces
  when passed as subpage.
* Pager's properly validate which fields are allowed to be sorted on.
* mw.util.tooltipAccessKeyRegexp: The regex now matches "option-" as well.
  Support for Mac "option" was added in 1.16, but the regex was never updated.
* (bug 46768) Usernames of blocking users now display correctly, even if numeric.
* (bug 39590) Self-transclusions now show the most up to date result always
  after save instead of being a revision behind.
* A bias in wfRandomString() toward digits 1-7 has been corrected. Generated
  strings will now start with digits 0 and 8-f as often as they should.
* (bug 45371) Removed Parser_LinkHooks and CoreLinkFunctions classes.
* (bug 41545) Allow <kbd>, <samp>, and <var> to be nested like allowed in html.
* PLURAL magic word no longer causes a PHP notice when no matching form exists.
* (bug 36641) Patrol page links no longer show on non-existent revisions.
* (bug 35810) Pages not linked from Special:RecentChanges or Special:NewPages
  are patrollable now.
* (bug 30213) JavaScript for search suggestions is now disabled when the API
  is disabled, and AJAX patrolling and watching are now disabled when use of
  the write API is not allowed.
* (bug 48294) API: Fix chunk upload async mode.
* (bug 46749) Broken files tracking category removed from pages if an image
  with that name is uploaded.
* (bug 14176) System messages that are empty were previously incorrectly treated
  as non-existent, causing a fallback to the default. This stopped users from
  overriding system messages to make them blank.
* (bug 48319) action=parse no longer returns an error if passed none of 'oldid',
  'pageid', 'page', 'title', and 'text' (e.g. if only passed 'summary'). A
  warning will instead be issued if 'title' is non-default, unless no props are
  requested.
* Special:Recentchangeslinked will now include upload log entries
* (bug 41281) Fixed ugly output if file size could not be extracted for multi-page media.
* (bug 50315) list=logevents API module will now output log entries by anonymous users.
* (bug 38911) Handle headers with rowspan in jquery.tablesorter
* (bug 658) Converted the table of contents on wiki pages from <table> to <div>
  and adjusted skin CSS accordingly. The CSS was carefully crafted to be
  backwards-compatible in all reasonable cases (uses of the __TOC__ magic word,
  the #toc CSS id and the .toc CSS class). However, particularly bad abuse of
  the id or the class can possibly break.
* CSSJanus now supports rgb, hsl, rgba, and hsla color syntaxes.
* Special:Listfiles can no longer be sorted by image name when filtering
  by user in miser mode.
* (bug 49074) CSSJanus: Handle values of border-radius correctly.
* Handle relative inclusions ({{../name}}) in main namespace with subpages
  enabled correctly (previously MediaWiki tried to include Template:Parent/name
  instead of just Parent/name).
* Added $wgAPIUselessQueryPages to allow extensions to flag their query pages
  for non-inclusion in ApiQueryQueryPages.
* (bug 50870) mediawiki.notification: Notification area should remain visible
  when scrolled down.
* (bug 13438) Special:MIMESearch no longer an expensive special page.

  the function apache_request_headers() function is not available.
* (bug 33399) LivePreview: Re-run wikipage content handlers
  (jquery.makeCollapsible, jquery.tablesorter) after preview content is loaded.
* (bug 51891) Fixed PHP notice on Special:PagesWithProp when no properties
  are defined.
* (bug 52006) Corrected documentation of $wgTranscludeCacheExpiry.
* (bug 52077) The APIEditBeforeSave hook is giving the content of the whole
  revision as second argument now, rather than just the current section.
* (bug 49694) $wgSpamRegex is now also applied on the new section headline text
  adding a new topic on a page
* (bug 41756) Improve treatment of multiple comments on a blank line.
* (bug 51064) Purge upstream caches when deleting file assets.
* (bug 39012) File types with a mime that we do not know the extension for
  can no longer be uploaded as an extension that we do know the mime type
  for.
* (bug 51742) Add data-sort-value for better sorting of hitcounts Special:Tags
* (bug 26811) On DB error pages, server hostnames are now hidden when both
  $wgShowHostnames and $wgShowSQLErrors are false.
* (bug 6200) line breaks in <blockquote> are handled like they are in <div>
* (bug 14931) Default character set now set to 'utf8' when a new MySQL
  database is created.
* (bug 47191) Fixed "Column 'si_title' cannot be part of FULLTEXT index"
  MySQL error when installing using the binary character set option.
* (bug 45288) Support mysqli PHP extension
* (bug 55818) BREAKING CHANGE: Removed undocumented 'Debug' hook in wfDebug.
  This resolves an infinite loop when using $wgDebugFunctionEntry = true.
* (bug 56707) Correct tooltip of "Next n results" on query special pages.
* (bug 56770) mw.util.addPortletLink: Check length before access array index.

=== API changes in 1.22 ===
* (bug 25553) The JSON output formatter now leaves forward slashes unescaped
  to improve human readability of URLs and similar strings. Also, a "utf8"
  option is now provided to use UTF-8 encoding instead of hex escape codes
  for most non-ASCII characters.
* (bug 46626) xmldoublequote parameter was removed. Because of a bug, the
  parameter has had no effect since MediaWiki 1.16, and so its removal is
  unlikely to impact existing clients.
* (bug 47216) action=query&meta=siteinfo&siprop=skins will now indicate which
  skin is the default and which are unusable (e.g. listed in $wgSkipSkins).
* (bug 25325) Added support for wlshow filtering (bots/anon/minor/patrolled)
  to action=feedwatchlist.
* WDDX formatted output will actually be formatted (and normal output will no
  longer be), and will no longer choke on booleans.
* action=opensearch no longer silently ignores the format parameter.
* action=opensearch now supports format=jsonfm.
* list=usercontribs&ucprop=ids will now include the parent revision id.
* BREAKING CHANGE: action=parse no longer returns all langlinks for the page
  with prop=langlinks by default. The new effectivelanglinks parameter will
  request that the LanguageLinks hook be called to determine the effective
  language links.
* BREAKING CHANGE: list=allpages, list=langbacklinks, and prop=langlinks do not
  apply the new LanguageLinks hook, and thus only consider language links
  stored in the database.
* (bug 47219) Allow specifying change type of Wikipedia feed items
* prop=imageinfo now allows setting iiurlheight without setting iiurlwidth
* prop=info now adds the content model and page language of the title.
* New upload log entries will now contain information on the relevant
  image (sha1 and timestamp).
* (bug 49239) action=parse now can parse in preview and section preview modes.
* (bug 49259) action=patrol now accepts revision ids.
* (bug 48129) list=blocks&bkip= now correctly handles IPv6 CIDR ranges and
  honors $wgBlockCIDRLimit. Note any clients passing invalid values to bkip
  will now receive an error, rather than the previous behavior listing all
  user blocks.
* (bug 48201) action=parse&text=foo now assumes wikitext if no title is given,
  rather than using the content model of the page "API".
* action=watch no longer silently ignores hook abort.
* (bug 50785) action=purge with forcelinkupdate=1 no longer queues refreshLinks
  jobs in the job queue for link table updates of pages that use the given page
  as a template. Instead, forcerecursivelinkupdate=1 is introduced and should
  be used if that behaviour is desirable.
* The 'debugLog' property (enabled by $wgDebugToolbar) no longer sets the log
  entry values through ApiResult::content but directly. This changes the JSON
  output from an array of objects with content in '*' to an array of strings
  with the content.
* (bug 51342) prop=imageinfo iicontinue now contains the dbkey, not the text
  version of the title.
* (bug 52538) action=edit will now use empty text instead of the contents
  of section 0 when passed prependtext or appendtext with section=new.
* Support for the 'gettoken' parameter to action=block and action=unblock,
  deprecated since 1.20, has been removed.
* (bug 49090) Token-getting functions will fail when using jsonp callbacks.
* (bug 52699) action=upload returns normalized file name on warning
  "exists-normalized" instead of filename to be uploaded to.
* (bug 53884) action=edit will now return an error when the specified section
  does not exist in the page.
* Added meta=filerepoinfo API module for getting information about foreign
  file repositories, and related ForeignAPIRepo methods getInfo and getApiUrl.
* The new query module list=allfileusages to enumerate file usages was added.

=== Languages updated in 1.22===

MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated
regularly. Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as
changes to languages because of Bugzilla reports.

* Batak Toba (bbc-latn) added.
* (bug 46751) Made Buryat (Russia) (буряад) (bxr) fallback to Russian.

=== Other changes in 1.22 ===
* BREAKING CHANGE: Implementation of MediaWiki's JS and JSON value encoding
  has changed:
** MediaWiki no longer supports PHP installations in which the native JSON
   extension is missing or disabled.
** XmlJsCode objects can no longer be nested inside objects or arrays.
   (For Xml::encodeJsCall(), this individually applies to each argument.)
** The sets of characters escaped by default, along with the precise escape
   sequences used, have changed (except for the Xml::escapeJsString()
   function, which is now deprecated).
* BREAKING CHANGE: The Services_JSON class has been removed. If necessary,
  be sure to upgrade affected extensions at the same time (e.g. Collection).
* redirect.php was removed. It was unused.
* ClickTracking integration was dropped from the mediaWiki.user.bucket
  JavaScript function. The 'tracked' option is now ignored.
* BREAKING CHANGE: Legacy skins Simple, MySkin, Chick, Standard and Nostalgia
  were all removed. (Nostalgia was moved to an extension.) The SkinLegacy and
  LegacyTemplate classes that supported them were removed as well and are now a
  part of the Nostalgia extension.
* Event namespace used by jquery.makeCollapsible has been changed from
  'mw-collapse' to 'mw-collapsible' for consistency with the module name.
* BREAKING CHANGE: The "ExternalAuth" authentication subsystem was removed, along
  with its associated globals of $wgExternalAuthType, $wgExternalAuthConf,
  $wgAutocreatePolicy and $wgAllowPrefChange. Affected users are encouraged to
  use AuthPlugin for external authentication/authorization needs.
* The Quickbar feature of the legacy skin model and the last remnants of it
  throughout the code base have been removed.
* Externaledit/externaldiff preference was removed. Very few users used this
  feature, and improper configuration can actually prevent a user from editing
* Calling Linker methods using a skin will now output deprecation warnings.
* (bug 46680) "Return to" links are no longer tagged with rel="next".
* BREAKING CHANGE: mw.util.tooltipAccessKeyRegexp: The match group for the
  accesskey character is now $6 instead of $5.
* HipHop compiler (hphpc) support was removed. HipHop VM support (hhvm) was
  added.
* A new Special:Redirect page was added, providing lookup by revision ID,
  user ID, or file name.  The old Special:Filepath page was reimplemented
  to redirect through Special:Redirect.
* Monobook: Removed the old conditional stylesheets for Opera 6, 7 and 9.
* Support for XHTML 1.0 has been removed. MediaWiki now only outputs (X)HTML5.
* wikibits: User-agent related globals have been deprecated. The following
  properties now default to false and emit mw.log.warn: is_gecko, is_chrome_mac,
  is_chrome, webkit_version, is_safari_win, is_safari, webkit_match, is_ff2,
  ff2_bugs, is_ff2_win, is_ff2_x11, opera95_bugs, opera7_bugs, opera6_bugs,
  is_opera_95, is_opera_preseven, is_opera, and ie6_bugs.
* (bug 48276) MediaWiki will now flash a confirmation message upon successfully
  editing a page.
* (bug 40785) mediawiki.legacy.ajax has been marked as deprecated. The following
  properties now emit mw.log.warn when accessed: sajax_debug, sajax_init_object,
  sajax_do_call and wfSupportsAjax.
* BREAKING CHANGE: meta keywords are no longer supported. A <meta name="keywords"
  will no longer be output and OutputPage::addKeyword no longer exists.
* Methods Title::userCanEditCssSubpage and Title::userCanEditJsSubpage,
  deprecated since 1.19, have been removed.
* (bug 50134) Hook functions are no longer required to return a value. When a
  hook function does not return a value (or when it returns an explicit null),
  processing continues. To abort the hook, a hook function must return an
  explicit, boolean false or a string error message. Other falsey values are
  tantamount to a 'return true' in earlier versions of MediaWiki.
* BREAKING CHANGE: The EditSectionLink hook was removed after being
  deprecated since MediaWiki 1.14. Use DoEditSectionLink instead.
* (bug 48256) The 'editsection-brackets' optional message was removed.
  Section edit links' brackets can now be customized using CSS by
  styling span.mw-editsection-bracket.
* The usePatrol function in ChangesList has been marked as deprecated.
* (bug 50785) A "null edit", that is, a save action in which no changes to the
  page text are made and no revision recorded, will no longer send refreshLinks
  jobs to the job table to update pages which use the edited page as a template.
* The LivePreviewPrepare and LivePreviewDone events triggered on "jQuery( mw )"
  have been deprecated in favour of using mw.hook.
* The 'showjumplinks' user preference has been removed, jump links are now
  always included.
* Methods RecentChange::notifyRC2UDP, RecentChange::sendToUDP, and
  RecentChange::cleanupForIRC have been deprecated, as it is now the
  responsibility of classes implementing the RCFeedFormatter and RCFeedEngine
  interfaces to implement the formatting and delivery for recent change
  notifications.
* SpecialPrefixindex methods namespacePrefixForm() and showPrefixChunk() have
  been made protected. They were accepting form variance arguments, this is now
  using properties in the SpecialPrefixindex class.
* (bug 50310) BREAKING CHANGE: wikibits: Drop support for mwCustomEditButtons.
  It defaults to an empty array and emits mw.log.warn when accessed.
* BREAKING CHANGE: Special:Disambiguations has been removed from MediaWiki core.
  Functions related to disambiguation pages are now handled by the Disambiguator
  extension (https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Disambiguator) (bug
  35981).
* BREAKING CHANGE: The 'mediawiki.legacy.wikiprintable' module has been removed.
  The skins/common/wikiprintable.css file no longer exists. Return value of
  Skin#commonPrintStylesheet is ignored. Please use the 'mediawiki.legacy.commonPrint'
  module instead or base your skin on SkinTemplate.
* (bug 49629) The hook ExtractThumbParamaters has been deprecated in favour
  of media handler overriding MediaHandler::parseParamString.
* (bug 46512) The collapsibleNav feature from the Vector extension has been moved
  to the Vector skin in core.
* SpecialRecentChanges::addRecentChangesJS() function has been renamed
  to addModules() and made protected.
* Methods WatchAction::doWatch and WatchAction::doUnwatch now return a Status
  object instead of a boolean.
* Information boxes (CSS classes errorbox, warningbox, successbox) have been
  made more subtle.
* BREAKING CHANGE: The module 'mediawiki.legacy.IEFixes' has been removed as it was
  unused. The file skins/common/IEFixes.js remains but is only used by wikibits.
  The file never contained any re-usable components. To use it in a skin, load
  'mediawiki.legacy.wikibits' (which IEFixes depends on) and that will import
  IEFixes automatically if user agent conditions are met.
* Code specific to the Math extension was marked as deprecated.
* mediawiki.util: mw.util.wikiGetlink has been renamed to getUrl. (The old name
  still works, but is deprecated.)

  without the unwatchedpages permission.
* $wgBug34832TransitionalRollback has been removed.
* (bug 29472) $wgUseDynamicDates has been removed and its functionality
  disabled.

=== New features in 1.21 ===
* (bug 38110) Schema changes (adding or dropping tables, indices and
  fields) can be now be done separately from from other changes that
  update.php makes.  This is useful in environments that use database
  permissions to restrict schema changes but allow the DB user that
  MediaWiki normally runs as to perform other changes that update.php
  makes.  Schema changes can be run separately.  See the file UPGRADE
  for more information.
* (bug 34876) jquery.makeCollapsible has been improved in performance.
* Added ContentHandler facility to allow extensions to support other content
  than wikitext. See docs/contenthandler.txt for details.
* New feature was developed for showing high-DPI thumbnails for high-DPI mobile
  and desktop displays (configurable with $wgResponsiveImages).
* Added new backend to represent and store information about sites and site
  specific configuration.
* jQuery upgraded from 1.8.2 to 1.8.3.
* jQuery UI upgraded from 1.8.23 to 1.8.24.
* Added separate fa_sha1 field to filearchive table. This allows sha1
  searches with the api in miser mode for deleted files.
* Add initial and programmatic sorting for tablesorter.
* Add the event "sortEnd.tablesorter", triggered after sorting has completed.
* The Job system was refactored to allow for different backing stores for
  queues as well as cross-wiki access to queues, among other things. The schema
  for the DB queue was changed to support better concurrency and reduce
  deadlock errors.
* Added ApiQueryORM class to facilitate creation of query API modules based on
  tables that have a corresponding ORMTable class.
* (bug 40876) Icon for PSD (Adobe Photoshop) file types.
* (bug 40641) Implemented Special:Version/Credits with a list of contributors.
* (bug 7851) Implemented one-click AJAX patrolling.
* The <data>, <time>, <meta>, and <link> elements are allowed within WikiText
  for use with Microdata.
* The HTML5 <mark> tag has been whitelisted.
* Added ParserCloned hook for when the Parser object is cloned.
* Added AlternateEditPreview hook to allow extensions to replace the page
  preview from the edit page.
* Added EditPage::showStandardInputs:options hook to allow extensions to add
  new fields to the "editOptions" area of the edit form.
* Upload stash DB schema altered to improve upload performance.
* The following global functions are now reporting deprecated warnings in
  debug mode: wfMsg, wfMsgNoTrans, wfMsgForContent, wfMsgForContentNoTrans,
  wfMsgReal, wfMsgGetKey, wfMsgHtml, wfMsgWikiHtml, wfMsgExt, wfEmptyMsg. Use
  the Message class, or the global method wfMessage.
* Added $wgEnableCanonicalServerLink, off by default. If enabled, a
  <link rel=canonical> tag is added to every page indicating the correct server
  to use.
* Debug message emitted by wfDebugLog() will now be prefixed with the group
  name when its logged to the default log file. That is the case whenever the
  group has no key in wgDebugLogGroups, that will help triage the default log.
* (bug 24620) Add types to LogFormatter.
* jQuery JSON upgraded from 2.3 to 2.4.0.
* Added GetDoubleUnderscoreIDs hook, for modifying the list of magic words.
* DatabaseUpdater class has two new methods to ease extensions schema changes:
  dropExtensionIndex and renameExtensionIndex.
* New preference type - 'api'. Preferences of this type are not shown on
  Special:Preferences, but are still available via the action=options API.
* (bug 39397) Hide rollback link if a user is the only contributor of the page.
* $wgPageInfoTransclusionLimit limits the list size of transcluded articles
  on the info action. Default is 50.
* Added action=createaccount to allow user account creation.
* (bug 40124) action=options API also allows for setting of arbitrary
  preferences, provided that their names are prefixed with 'userjs-'. This
  officially reenables the feature that was undocumented and defective
  in MW 1.20 (saving preferences using Special:Preferences cleared any
  additional fields) and which has been disabled in 1.20.1 as a part of
  a security fix (bug 42202).
* Added option to specify "others" as author in extension credits using
  "..." as author name.
* Added the ability to limit the wall clock time used by shell processes,
  as well as the CPU time. Configurable with $wgMaxShellWallClockTime.
* Allow memory of shell subprocesses to be limited using Linux cgroups
  instead of ulimit -v, which tends to cause deadlocks in recent versions
  of ImageMagick. Configurable with $wgShellCgroup.
* Added $wgWhitelistReadRegexp for regex whitelisting.
* (bug 5346) Categories that are redirects will be displayed italic in
  the category links section at the bottom of a page.
* (bug 43915) New maintenance script deleteEqualMessages.php.
* You can now create checkbox option matrices through the HTMLCheckMatrix
  subclass in HTMLForm.
* WikiText now permits the use of WAI-ARIA's role="presentation" inside of
  html elements and tables. This allows presentational markup, especially
  tables. To be marked up as such.
* maintenance/sql.php learned the --cluster option. Let you run the script
  on some external cluster instead of the primary cluster for a given wiki.
* (bug 20281) test the parsing of inline URLs.
* Added Special:PagesWithProp, which lists pages using a particular page property.
* Implemented language-specific collations for category sorting for 67 languages
  based in latin, greek and cyrillic alphabets. This allows one to *finally* get
  articles to be correctly sorted on category pages. They are named
  'uca-<langcode>', where <langcode> is one of: af, ast, az, be, bg, br, bs, ca,
  co, cs, cy, da, de, dsb, el, en, eo, es, et, eu, fi, fo, fr, fur, fy, ga, gd,
  gl, hr, hsb, hu, is, it, kk, kl, ku, ky, la, lb, lt, lv, mk, mo, mt, nl, no,
  oc, pl, pt, rm, ro, ru, rup, sco, sk, sl, smn, sq, sr, sv, tk, tl, tr, tt, uk,
  uz, vi.
* Added 'CategoryAfterPageAdded' and 'CategoryAfterPageRemoved' hooks.
* Added 'HistoryRevisionTools' and 'DiffRevisionTools' hooks.
* Added 'SpecialSearchResultsPrepend' and 'SpecialSearchResultsAppend' hooks.
* (bug 33186) Add image rotation api "imagerotate"
* (bug 34040) Add "User rights management" link on user page toolbox.
* (bug 45526) Add QUnit assertion helper "QUnit.assert.htmlEqual" for asserting
  structual equality of HTML (ignoring insignificant differences like
  quotmarks, order and whitespace in the attribute list).
* (bug 23393) HTML <hN> headings containing line breaks are now handled
  correctly.
* (bug 45803) Whitespace within == Headline == syntax and within <hN> headings
  is now non-significant and not preserved in the HTML output.

* (bug 40352) fixDoubleRedirects.php should support interwiki redirects.
* (bug 9237) SpecialBrokenRedirect should not list interwiki redirects.
* (bug 34960) Drop unused fields rc_moved_to_ns and rc_moved_to_title from
  recentchanges table.
* (bug 32951) Do not register internal externals with absolute protocol,
  when server has relative protocol.
* (bug 39005) When purging proxies listed in $wgSquidServers using HTTP PURGE
  method requests, we now send a Host header by default, for Varnish
  compatibility. This also works with Squid in reverse-proxy mode. If you wish
  to support Squid configured in forward-proxy mode, set
  $wgSquidPurgeUseHostHeader to false.
* (bug 37020) sql.php with readline eats semicolon.
* (bug 11748) Properly handle optionally-closed HTML tags when Tidy is
  disabled, and don't wrap HTML-syntax definition lists in paragraphs.

  current revision.
* (bug 41494) Honor $wgLogExceptionBacktrace when logging non-API exceptions

  didn't show up red.

  parameter.
* (bug 42036) Account creation emails now contain canonical (not
  protocol-relative) URLs.

  starttimestamp and basetimestamp should not cause an edit conflict.
* (bug 41706) EditPage: Preloaded page should be converted if possible and
  needed.
* (bug 41886) Rowspans are no longer exploded by tablesorter until the table is
  actually sorted.
* (bug 2865)  User interface HTML elements don't use lang attribute.
  (completed the fix by adding the lang attribute to firstHeading).
* (bug 42173) Removed namespace prefixes on Special:UncategorizedCategories.
* (bug 36053) Log in "returnto" feature forgets query parameters if no
  title parameter was specified.
* (bug 42410) API action=edit now returns correct timestamp for the new edit.
* (bug 14901) Email notification mistakes log action for new page creation.
  Enotif no longer sends "page has been created" notifications for some log
  actions. The following events now have a correct message: page creation,
  deletion, move, restore (undeletion), change (edit). Parameter
  $CHANGEDORCREATED is deprecated in 'enotif_body' and scheduled for removal in
  MediaWiki 1.23.
* (bug 457) In the sidebar of Vector, CologneBlue, Monobook, and Monobook-based
  skins, the heading levels have been changed from (variously per skin)
  <h4>, <h5> or <h6> to only <h3>s, with a <h2> hidden heading above them.
  If you are styling or scripting the headings in a custom way, this change
  will require updates to your site's CSS or JS.
* (bug 41342) jquery.suggestions should cancel any active (async) fetches
  before it triggers another fetch.

  a fatal error.
* (bug 44775) The username field is not pre-filled when creating an account.

=== API changes in 1.21 ===
* prop=revisions can now report the contentmodel and contentformat.
  See docs/contenthandler.txt.
* action=edit and action=parse now support contentmodel and contentformat
  parameters to control the interpretation of page content.
  See docs/contenthandler.txt for details.

* list=alllinks & alltransclusions now allow both 'from' and 'continue' in
  the same query. When both are present, 'from' is simply ignored.
* list=alllinks & alltransclusions now allow 'unique' in generators, to yield
  a list of all link/template target pages instead of source pages.
* BREAKING CHANGE: list=logevents output format changed for details of some log
  types. Specifically, details that were formerly reported under a key like
  "4::foo" will now be reported under a key of simply "foo".
* BREAKING CHANGE: '??_badcontinue' error code was changed to '??badcontinue'
  for all query modules.
* ApiQueryBase adds 'badcontinue' error code if module has 'continue' parameter.

* ApiQueryImageInfo continuation is more reliable. The only major change is
  that the imagerepository property will no longer be set on page objects not
  processed in the current query (i.e. non-images or those skipped due to
  iicontinue).
* Add supports for all pageset capabilities - generators, redirects, converttitles to
  action=purge and action=setnotificationtimestamp.
* (bug 43251) prop=pageprops&ppprop= now accepts multiple props to query.
* ApiQueryImageInfo will now limit the number of calls to File::transform made
  in any one query. If there are too many, iicontinue will be returned.
* action=query&meta=siteinfo&siprop=general will now return the regexes used for
  link trails and link prefixes. Added for Parsoid support.

  currently in use on the wiki.

  recognized as an uploaded file.

  proper error instead of as an uncaught exception.
* (bug 25325) added support for wlshow filtering (bots/anon/minor/patrolled)
  to action=feedwatchlist
* WDDX formatted output will actually be formatted (and normal output will no
  longer be), and will no longer choke on booleans.

=== API internal changes in 1.21 ===
* For debugging only, a new global $wgDebugAPI removes many API restrictions when true.
  Never use on the production servers, as this flag introduces security holes.
  Whenever enabled, a warning will also be added to all output.
* ApiModuleManager now handles all submodules (actions,props,lists) and instantiation
* Query stores prop/list/meta as submodules
* ApiPageSet can now be used in any action to process titles/pageids/revids or any generator.

  first one keeping its meaning. ApiPageSet is now derived from ApiBase.
* BREAKING CHANGE: ApiQuery::newGenerator() and executeGeneratorModule() were deleted.
* ApiQueryGeneratorBase::setGeneratorMode() now requires a pageset param.
* $wgAPIGeneratorModules is now obsolete and will be ignored.
* Added flags ApiResult::OVERRIDE and ADD_ON_TOP to setElement() and addValue()
* Internal API calls will now include <warnings> in case of unused parameters

=== Languages updated in 1.21 ===

MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated
regularly. Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as
changes to languages because of Bugzilla reports.

* South Azerbaijani (azb) added.
* (bug 30040) Autonym for nds-nl is now 'Nedersaksies' (was 'Nedersaksisch').
* (bug 45436) Autonym for pi (Pali) is now 'पालि' (was ''पाळि').
* (bug 34977) Now formatted numbers in Spanish use space as separator
  for thousands, as mandated by the Real Academia Española.
* (bug 35031) Kurdish formatted numbers now use period and comma
  as separators for thousands and decimals respectively.

=== Other changes in 1.21 ===
* BREAKING CHANGE: (bug 44385) Removed the jquery.collapsibleTabs module and
  moved it to the Vector extension. It was entirely Vector-extension-specific,
  deeply interconnected with the extension, and this functionality really
  belongs to the extension instead of the skin anyway. In the unlikely case you
  were using it, you have to either copy it to your extension, or install the
  Vector extension (and possibly disable its features using config settings if
  you don't want them).
* Experimental IBM DB2 support was removed due to lack of interest and maintainership
* BREAKING CHANGE: Filenames of maintenance scripts were standardized into
  lowerCamelCase format, and made more explicit:
  - clear_stats.php -> clearCacheStats.php
  - clear_interwiki_cache.php -> clearInterwikiCache.php
  - initStats.php -> initSiteStats.php
  - proxy_check.php -> proxyCheck.php
  - stats.php -> showCacheStats.php
  - showStats.php -> showSiteStats.php.
  Class names were renamed accordingly:
  - clear_stats -> ClearCacheStats
  - InitStats -> InitSiteStats
  - CacheStats -> ShowCacheStats
  - ShowStats -> ShowSiteStats.
* BREAKING CHANGE: (bug 38244) Removed the mediawiki.api.titleblacklist module
  and moved it to the TitleBlacklist extension.

changes to languages because of Bugzilla reports.

* Emilian (egl) added.
* Tornedalen Finnish (fit) added.

* The user_token field is now left empty until a user attempts to login and
  cookies need to be set. It is also now possible to reset every user's
  user_token simply by clearing the values in the user_token column.
* Removed ./tests/qunit/index.html from core. It wasn't actively maintained and
  has been made obsolete when [[Special:JavaScriptTest/qunit]] was introduced,
  which actually uses ResourceLoader, LocalSettings and the Skin.
* Removed $wgDBtransactions global. This was only checked in one class
  and only applies to MyISAM or similar DBs. Those should only be used
  for archived sites anyway. We can't get edit conflicts on such sites,
  so the WikiPage code wasn't useful there either.

* Deprecated DatabaseBase functions newFromParams(), newFromType(), set(),
  quote_ident(), and escapeLike() were removed.

* OutputPage::wrapWikiMsg() no longer supports the 'options' parameter. It was
  not used and complicated migration to Message class.

 'mediawiki.action.edit.preview' module. The old 'mediawiki.legacy.preview' module
  has been removed.
* (bug 40448) Removed mediawiki.legacy.mwsuggest module, and removed the
  following that has become obsolete:
  - globals $wgEnableMWSuggest and $wgMWSuggestTemplate.
  - mw.config.values wgMWSuggestTemplate and wgSearchNamespaces.
  - method SearchEngine::getMWSuggestTemplate().

  'chick' and 'monobook').

  using Title::isCssJsSubpage() or checking Title::isWrongCaseCssJsPage().
* Support for the deprecated hook MagicWordMagicWords was removed.
* The Xml::namespaceSelector method has been deprecated, please use
  Html::namespaceSelector instead (note that the parameters have changed also).

  for scripts missing dependencies.
  New configuration variable $wgPreloadJavaScriptMwUtil has been introduced for this
  (set to false by default for new installations). Set to true if your wiki has a large
  amount of user/site scripts that are lacking dependency information. In the short to
  medium term these user/site scripts should be fixed by adding the used modules to the
  dependencies in the module registry and/or wrapping them in a callback to mw.loader.using.

  variant of "User" can now be used.

  improved, and can now extract IPTC and XMP metadata.

* Improved directionality support in 1.18 means that MediaWiki is better to use for
  RTL users.

* Math support has been removed from core

  from watchlist.
* (bug 32183) remove the client-* classes added from user-agent-sniffing onto
  the <html> element.
* (bug 29912) Unit tests break if parsertest tables are still present.
* (bug 31694) During installation, tabbing order (cursor focus) goes to logo
  instead of 'continue'.
* (bug 29102) Upgrade fails "Unknown character set: 'mysql4".
* (bug 31990) justify paragraphs pref adds extra space to category listing.
* (bug 20148) Better title for [[Special:Disambiguations]] page.

=== Configuration changes in 1.18 ===
* The WantedPages::getSQL hook has been removed and replaced with
  WantedPages::getQueryInfo. This may break older extensions.
* The SkinTemplateBuildContentActionUrlsAfterSpecialPage,
  SkinTemplateContentActions and SkinTemplateTabs hooks have been removed in
  favor of SkinTemplateNavigation and SkinTemplateNavigation::SpecialPage.
* $wgUseCombinedLoginLink controls whether to output a combined
  login / create account link in the personal bar, or to output separate login
  and create account links.
* Skin names are no longer created based on a ucfirst version of the key in
  $wgValidSkinNames but now the value. This means for
  $wgValidSkinNames["monobook"] = "MonoBook"; the skin loader will no longer try
  loading SkinMonobook and will instead load SkinMonoBook.
* $wgMaxUploadSize may now be set to an array to specify the upload size limit
  per upload type.
* $wgAPICacheHelp added in 1.16 is now removed. To disable API help caching, set
  $wgAPICacheHelpTimeout = 0;
* OutputPage::isUserJsAllowed() no longer returns false when scripts are allowed
  by the page, but $wgAllowUserJs is set to false.
* Pure "Skin" class based custom skins are no longer supported, all custom skins
  should be put together using SkinTemplate and BaseTemplate or QuickTemplate.
* The transliteration for passwords in case they were migrated from an old
  Latin-1 install (previous to MediaWiki 1.5) is now only done for wikis with
  $wgLegacyEncoding set.
* (bug 27508) Add $wgSVGMetadataCutoff to limit the maximum amount of an SVG we
  look at when finding metadata to prevent excessive resource usage.
* $wgSysopUserBans and $wgSysopRangeBans (deprecated in 1.17) are now removed.
  Use $wgBlockCIDRLimit = array( 'IPv4' => 43, 'IPv6' => 128 ) to achieve the
  same functionality as $wgSysopRangeBans; you can use the BlockIp hook to
  replicate $wgSysopUserBans functionality.
* The options on the block form have been standardised such that checking a box
  makes the block 'more serious'; so while "check to prevent account creation"
  and "check to enable autoblock" remain the same, "check to allow user-talk
  edit" is reversed to "check to *disable* user-talk edit", and "check to block
  anon-only" becomes "check to block logged-in users too".  The default settings
  remain the same.
* Most of the field names on the Special:Block form have been changed, which
  will probably break screen-scraping bots.
* (bug 26866) The 'trackback' right is no longer granted to sysops by default.
  $wgUseTrackbacks is already false by default.
* (bug 17009) the hiddenStructure CSS class, a highly hackish way of at least
  *appearing* to hide article elements, has been removed.  Use the
  ParserFunctions extension to actually remove unwanted elements from the
  output.
* (bug 14202) $wgUseTeX has been superseded by the Math extension. To re-enable
  math conversion after upgrading, obtain the Math extension from SVN or from
  https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Math and add to LocalSettings.php:
  require_once "$IP/extensions/Math/Math.php";
* $wgProfiler is now a configuration array, see StartProfiler.sample for
  details.
* $wgProfiling has been removed.
* The spyc library is now no longer included in phase3.
* (bug 28343) Unused preferences contextlines/contextchars have been removed
* $wgSkinExtensionFunctions has been removed. Use $wgExtensionFunctions instead.
* $wgProto has been removed. You now only need to set $wgServer to change the
  URL protocol.
* $wgRateLimitsExcludedGroups (deprecated in 1.13) has been removed.
* $wgInputEncoding and $wgOutputEncoding (deprecated in 1.5) have now been removed.
* $wgAllowUserSkin (deprecated in 1.16) has now been removed.
* $wgExtraRandompageSQL (deprecated in 1.16) has now been removed.
* LogReader and LogViewer classes (deprecated in 1.14) have now been removed.
* (bug 26033) Added $wgArticleCountMethod to select the method to use to say
  whether a page is an article or not. $wgUseCommaCount is now deprecated.
* $wgEnableDublinCoreRdf and $wgEnableCreativeCommonsRdf no longer work in core,
  and the functionality has been moved to the relevant extensions. See
  https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:DublinCoreRdf and
  https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:CreativeCommonsRdf as appropriate.
* (bug 21107) Split error "customcssjsprotected" into separate messages for JS and CSS
* Removed $wgCheckCopyrightUpload from DefaultSettings, since the relevant feature
  was removed in about 1.5.
* LogPageValidTypes, LogPageLogName, LogPageLogHeader and LogPageActionText
  hooks have been removed.
* New hook "Collation::factory" to allow extensions to create custom
  category collations.
* $wgGroupPermissions now supports per namespace permissions.
* $wgEnableAutoRotation enables or disables auto-rotation. Leaving it set to
  null will cause MediaWiki to determine if auto-rotation is available.

=== New features in 1.18 ===
* BREAKING CHANGE: action=watch / action=unwatch now requires a token.
* BREAKING CHANGE: Article class hierarchy split into WikiPage (backend).
  and Article (frontend) hierarchies. Several hooks now pass a WikiPage object instead
  of an Article object. These hooks all use an $article paramater as documented in hooks.txt.
  Extensions should be updated to account for this, though most won't require any changes.
* (bug 27860) Minor edit after clicking 'new section' tab
  Now the "This is a minor edit" checkbox is not available when you
  create a page or new section.
* (bug 8130) Query pages should limit to content namespaces, not just main
  namespace.

  saved.

  to be selectively disabled.
* Alternative to $wgHooks implemented, using the new Hooks class.
* Add width parameter to Special:Filepath to allow getting the file path of a
  thumbnail.
* (bug 26870) Add size to {{filepath:}}.
* Upload warnings now show a thumbnail of the uploaded file.
* Introduced the edittools-upload message, which will be inserted under the
  upload form instead of edittools if available.
* (bug 26285) Extensions will be automatically generated on upload if the user
  specified a filename without extension.
* (bug 26851) Special:UserRights now allows to prefill the reason field
* New maintenance script to fix double redirects
  (maintenance/fixDoubleRedirects.php).
* (bug 23315) New body classes to allow easier styling of special pages.
* (bug 27159) Make email confirmation code expiration time configurable.
* (bug 29047) CSS/JS for each user group is imported from MediaWiki:Group-sysop.js,
  MediaWiki:Group-autoconfirmed.css, etc.
* (bug 24230) Uploads of ZIP types, such as MS Office or OpenOffice can now be
  safely enabled. A ZIP file reader was added which can scan a ZIP file for
  potentially dangerous Java applets. This allows applets to be blocked
  specifically, rather than all ZIP files being blocked.
* (bug 2429) Allow selection of associated namespace in recent changes.
* (bug 26217) File size is now checked before uploading in HTML5 browsers.
* CSS stylesheet MediaWiki:Noscript.css is now loaded for users with JavaScript
  disabled (enclosed in the head in a <noscript> tag).

* (bug 14645) When $wgMiserMode is on, expensive special pages are styled
  differently (italicized by default) on Special:SpecialPages.

  several wikis.
* When $wgAllowMicrodataAttributes is true, all itemtypes are allowed, not just
  the three that were defined in the original specification.
* (bug 14706) Added support for the Imagick PHP extension.
* (bug 18691) Added support for SVG rasterization using the Imagick PHP
  extension.

  file description page. The sizes are set by $wgImageLimits.
* (bug 28031) Add pageCount support to ArchivedFile.
* (bug 27924) PhpHttpRequest doesn't return response body if HTTP != 200.
* Added hook BitmapHandlerTransform to allow extension to transform a file

== MediaWiki 1.17 ==

== MediaWiki 1.17.5 ==
2012-06-12

This is a security release of the MediaWiki 1.17 branch.

=== Summary of selected changes in 1.17 ===

Selected changes since MediaWiki 1.16 that may be of interest:

* A new installer has been introduced. It has a wizard-style interface which is
  translated into many languages. Many shortcomings in the old installer were
  addressed with this rewrite. Note that it is no longer required for the config
  directory to be made writable by the webserver. Instead the generated
  LocalSettings.php file is offered as a download, which you must then upload
  to the wiki's base directory.

* ResourceLoader, a new framework for delivering client-side resources such as
  JavaScript and CSS, has been introduced. These resources are now delivered
  through the new entry point script "load.php", instead of as static files
  served directly by the web server. This allows minification, compression and
  client-side caching to be used more effectively, which should provide a net
  performance improvement for most users.

* Category sorting has been improved.
** Sorting is now case insensitive.
** Sub-categories, pages and files can now be paged separately.
** When several pages are given the same sort key, they sort by their
   names instead of randomly.

* The lowest supported version of PHP is now 5.2.3. If necessary, please
  upgrade PHP prior to upgrading MediaWiki.

=== Changes since 1.17.4 ===

* (bug 36938) Correctly escape uselang attribute to prevent xss
* Expanded Blacklist for SVG Files

=== Changes since 1.17.3 ===

* (bug 35671) PHP Notice: Undefined index: gettoken in includes/api/ApiMain.php
  on line 598.

=== Changes since 1.17.2 ===

* (bug 22555) Remove or skip strip markers from tag hooks like &lt;nowiki&gt; in
  core parser functions which operate on strings, such as padleft.
* (bug 34212) ApiBlock/ApiUnblock allow action to take place without a token
  parameter present.
* (bug 34907) Fixed exposure of tokens through load.php that could have facilitated
  CSRF attacks.
* (bug 35317) CSRF in Special:Upload.

=== Changes since 1.17.1 ===
* (bug 33117) prop=revisions allows deleted text to be exposed through cache pollution.
* (bug 32709) Private Wiki users were always taken to Special:Badtitle on login.

=== Changes since 1.17.0 ===

* (bug 29535) Added missing Creative Commons CC0 icon.
* (bug 29726) Fixed failure to load internationalization messages in
  client-side scripts on WebKit-based browsers.
* Fixed a bug in message transformation where the previous language could leak
  into later transformations in the UI language.
* (bug 29091) Fixed form of native name for Ossetic language (Иронау -> Ирон)
* Fixed maintenance scripts upgrade1_5.php and rebuildImages.php, they did not
  work at all since 1.17 beta 1.
* (bug 29531) Fixed img_auth.php for thumbnails and other filenames with
  multiple dots, was broken by the fix for bug 28840.
* In the maintenance script purgeList.php, fixed a fatal error when a page
  title is given, instead of a URL.
* (bug 19514) Unordered list list-style-image should be IE6-compatible (8-bit).
* Installer checked for magic_quotes_runtime instead of register_globals.
* $wgSVGMaxSize is now applied to the smaller of width or height, making very
  wide pano/timeline/diagram SVGs renderable at saner sizes.
* (bug 29959) Installer fatal when cURL and allow_url_fopen is disabled and user
  tries to subsribe to mediawiki-announce.
* Installer checked for magic_quotes_runtime instead of register_globals
* (bug 30131) XCache with variable caching disabled no longer used for variable
  caching (CACHE_ACCEL)
* (bug 30264) Changed installer-generated LocalSettings.php to use require_once()
  instead require() for included extensions.
* (bug 26486) ResourceLoader modules with paths to nonexistent files cause PHP
  warnings/notices to be thrown
* (bug 30907) Special:Unusedcategories should sort ascendingly.
* (bug 30219) The page shown when LocalSettings.php does not exist was broken on
  Windows servers.
* Hardcoded NLS_NUMERIC_CHARACTERS for Oracle DB to prevent type conversion errors.
* Fixed recentchanges FK violation on page delete and cache purge error in updater
  for Oracle DB.
* (bug 32276) Skins were generating output using the internal page title which
  would allow anonymous users to determine wheter a page exists, potentially
  leaking private data. In fact, the curid and oldid request parameters would
  allow page titles to be enumerated even when they are not guessable.
* (bug 32616) action=ajax requests were dispatched to the relevant internal
  functions without any read permission checks being done. This could lead to
  data leakage on private wikis.

=== Changes since 1.17.0rc1 ===

* Fixed syntax error in generated LocalSettings.php when a non-default user
  rights profile is chosen.
* (bug 29399) Fixed PostgreSQL installation when the DB user for installation
  is the same as the one for web access.
* (bug 29233) Fixed failover for DB slave servers. When a DB slave went down,
  an error was immediately shown to the user, instead of trying another slave.
  Was broken since 1.17 beta 1.
* (bug 29278) Fixed PHP fatal error when attempting to add text to a page via a
  redirect.
* (bug 29408) Fixed uploads of files with MIME types that aren't detected by
  MediaWiki.
* Removed DEFAULT '' NOT NULL field definitions from Oracle DB schema because
  using the DEFAULT value ('') in DML broke Oracle backend as it treats an
  empty VARCHAR2 value as NULL. Indexes on Oracle do not require NOT NULL
  fields.

=== Changes since 1.17 beta 1 ===

* Fixed warning about missing file "password.js".
* When installing on MySQL, don't attempt to create a new database user if the
  same user is used for installation and web access.
* Fixed SQL query errors in queries with table aliases.
* (bug 27891) Fixed the "chronology protector", broken since 1.17beta1, which
  ensures that when database replication is used, the new version is seen by
  the user immediately after they create or edit an article.
* (bug 28845) Allow PostgreSQL installation using a non-root user account which
  has role creation abilities.
* When installing on PostgreSQL and the install account is the same as the web
  account, check to make sure that the account has suitable privileges in the
  mediawiki schema.
* (bug 28172) Fixed error in PostgreSQL installation when creating the wiki
  sysop account.
* Fixed an issue with the Oracle installer in cases where the user is different
  to the database name.
* Added "unblockself" to the list of available rights.
* In the installer, fixed the "user rights profile" option, it never worked.
* (bug 29117) Fixed Hebrew localisation of the installer.
* (bug 28840) Reduce the collateral damage caused by the fix for bug 28235 (XSS
  on Internet Explorer 6 due to a file extension in the query string) by
  reducing the number of URLs that are blocked, and by redirecting the request
  to a safer URL where possible instead of blocking it.
* (bug 28812) Fixed documentation of API action=parse.
* (bug 28979) Fixed styling of <abbr> and <acronym>.
* Fixed the error message displayed when you try to create an account by email,
  but an email address is not given.
* Fixed JS error due to missing dependency for jquery.suggestions.
* Exposed $wgExtensionAssetsPath in JavaScript.
* (bug 28738) Made ResourceLoader support environments with small URL length
  limits. The length limit can be configured via $wgResourceLoaderMaxQueryLength,
  and this is set automatically in the generated LocalSettings.php when the
  php.ini variable "suhosin.get.max_value_length" is set. When a URL exceeds
  this limit, the request is split up. Also, reduced the average length of
  load.php URLs by using a more compact parameter format.
* (bug 25262) Fix for minification of hardcoded data: URIs in CSS.
* (bug 25124) Respect $wgStyleDirectory in ResourceLoader.
* Allow installation when no HTTP client is available, don't throw an exception.
* (bug 27465) Fix metadata extraction for SVG files using unusual namespace
  names.
* (bug 29174) Fix regression in upload-by-URL: uploading files larger than the
  PHP memory limit should work again.
* Fixed the display of comments in the new user log.
* (bug 28237) When installing extensions using the web-based installer, create
  any necessary database tables.
* (bug 28983) Fixed automated installation of extensions that overwrite $path.
* Fixed error caused by missing magic words.
* Fixed breakage of article editing in PostgreSQL due to text search
  configuration errors.
* Fixed the HTTPS client used when Curl is not available. This avoids an error
  during install about failure of the mediawiki-announce subscription.
* (bug 28162) When installing to PostgreSQL, respect the "database port" input,
  it was ignored.

=== Configuration changes in 1.17 ===

* $wgLogAutocreatedAccounts controls whether autocreation of accounts is logged
  to new users log.
* (bug 22858) $wgLocalStylePath is by default set to the same value as
  $wgStylePath but should never point to a different domain than the site is
  on, allowing skins to use .htc files which are not cross-domain friendly.
* $wgFileStore has been deprecated. The only usage $wgFileStore['deleted'] has
  been turned into $wgDeletedDirectory.
* $wgDeletedDirectory has been added to specify what directory to place deleted
  uploads in.
* IBM DB2 database no longer uses the db specific $wgDBport_db2 variable but the
  normal $wgDBport.
* $wgCategoryPrefixedDefaultSortkey was removed and is now always false.  This
  provides more sensible sorting behavior for categories.
* Removed unused globals: $wgEnableSerializedMessages, $wgCheckSerialized,
  $wgUseMemCached, $wgDisableSearchContext, $wgColorErrors, $wgUseZhdaemon,
  $wgZhdaemonHost and $wgZhdaemonPort.
* (bug 24408) The include_path is not modified in the default LocalSettings.php
* $wgVectorExtraStyles was removed, and is no longer in use.
* Removed $wgUpdates for database updates; extensions should use
  DatabaseUpdater::addExtensionUpdate() via the LoadExtensionSchemaUpdates hook.
* Removed $wgServerName. It doesn't need to be set anymore and is no longer
  available as input for other configuration items, either.
* It's no longer necessary for LocalSettings.php to include DefaultSettings.php.
* It's no longer necessary to set $wgCacheEpoch to the file modification time
  of LocalSettings.php, in LocalSettings.php itself. Instead, this is done
  automatically if $wgInvalidateCacheOnLocalSettingsChange is true (which is
  the default).
* $wgCopyrightIcon is deprecated and $wgFooterIcons['copyright']['copyright']
  should be used instead.
* $wgSysopUserBans is deprecated, and will be made permanently true in 1.18.
  If you need this functionality, you should use the BlockIp hook to filter and
  reject such blocks.
* $wgSysopRangeBans is deprecated, you should set $wgBlockCIDRLimit to maximum
  (32 for IPv4, 128 for IPv6), equivalent to allowing rangeblocks of only 1
  address at a time.

* (bug 9257) $wgRCMaxAge now defaults to three months
* $wgDevelopmentWarnings can be set to true to show warnings about deprecated
  functions and other potential errors when developing.
* Subpages are now enabled in the MediaWiki namespace by default.  This is
  mainly a cosmetic change, and does not in any way affect the MessageCache,
  which was already effectively treating the namespace as if it had subpages.
* Oracle: maintenance/ora/user.sql script for creating DB user on oracle with
  appropriate privileges. Creating this user with web-install page requires
  oci8.privileged_connect set to On in php.ini.
* Removed UserrightsChangeableGroups hook introduced in 1.14
* Added $wgCacheDirectory, to replace $wgFileCacheDirectory,
  $wgLocalMessageCache, and any other local caches which need a place to put
  files.
* $wgFileCacheDirectory is no longer set to anything by default, and so either
  needs to be set explicitly, or $wgCacheDirectory needs to be set instead.
* $wgLocalMessageCache has been removed. Instead, set $wgUseLocalMessageCache
  to true
* Removed $wgEnableSerializedMessages and $wgCheckSerialized. Similar
  functionality is now available via $wgLocalisationCacheConf.

  backward compatibility)

  exist. In that case the URL will get (?|&)wpDestFile=<filename> appended to
  it as appropriate.
* If $wgLocaltimezone is null, use the server's timezone as the default for
  signatures. This was always the behavior documented in DefaultSettings.php
  but has not been the actual behavior for some time: instead, UTC was used
  by default.
* Added $wgExtensionAssetsPath, to decouple assets serving from $wgScriptPath.
  If not specified it will default to $wgScriptPath/extensions
* Added $wgCountTotalSearchHits to make search UI display total number of hits
  with some search engines.
* Added $wgAdvertisedFeedTypes to decide what feed types (RSS, Atom, both, or
  neither) MediaWiki advertises.  Default is array( 'atom' ), so RSS is no
  longer advertised by default (but it still works).
* Added $wgMemCachedTimeout, controls how long to wait for data from the
  memcached servers.
* New configuration variables $wgDebugTimestamps and $wgDebugPrintHttpHeaders
  for controlling debug output.
* New $wgBlockDisablesLogin when set to true disallows blocked users from

  the DBA extension is not available.
* Introduced a new system for localisation caching. The system is based around
  fast fetches of individual messages, minimising memory overhead and startup

  set $wgCacheDirectory to get a faster CDB-based implementation.
* Expanded the number of variables which can be set in the extension messages
  files.
* Added a feature to allow per-article process pool size control for the parsing
  task, to limit resource usage when the cache for a heavily-viewed article is

  use

  This can be disabled by setting $wgHtml5 = false;.  Specific features enabled
  if HTML 5 is used:

   obsolete in HTML 5 and wasn't useful here anyway.

changes to languages because of Bugzilla reports.

* Swiss Standard German (de-ch) (new)

== MediaWiki 1.14 ==

=== Configuration changes in 1.14 ===

* $wgExemptFromUserRobotsControl is an array of namespaces to be exempt from
  the effect of the new __INDEX__/__NOINDEX__ magic words.  (Default: null, ex-
  empt all content namespaces.)
* $wgForwardSearchUrl has been removed entirely. Documented setting since 1.4
  has been $wgSearchForwardUrl.
* (bug 15080) $wgOverrideSiteFeed has been added. Setting either
  $wgSiteFeed['rss'] or 'atom' to a URL will override the default Recent
  Changes feed that appears on all pages.
* $wgSQLiteDataDirMode has been introduced as the default directory mode for
  SQLite data directories on creation. Note that this setting is separate from
  $wgDirectoryMode, which applies to all normal dirs created by MediaWiki.
* $wgGroupsAddToSelf and $wgGroupsRemoveFromSelf now work more like
  $wgAddGroups and $wgRemoveGroups, where the user must belong to a specified
  group in order to add or remove those groups from themselves.
  Backwards compatibility is maintained.
* $wgRestrictDisplayTitle controls if the use of the {{DISPLAYTITLE}} magic
  word is restricted to titles equivalent to the actual page title. This
  is true per default, but can be set to false to allow any title.
* $wgSpamRegex may now be an array of multiple regular expressions.
* $wgAjaxSearch has been removed; use $wgEnableMWSuggest instead.
* Editing the MediaWiki namespace is now unconditionally restricted to people
  with the editinterface right, configuring this in $wgNamespaceProtection
  is not required.
* $wgAllowExternalImagesFrom may now be an array of multiple strings.
* Introduced $wgEnableImageWhitelist to toggle the on-wiki external image
  whitelist on or off.
* Added $wgRenderHashAppend to append some string to the parser cache and the
  sitenotice cache keys.
* $wgRCChangedSizeThreshold is now a positive integer by default,
* (bug 16006) $wgEnableWriteAPI is now true by default. Authorized can perform
  write actions using the API.
* Added $wgRC2UDPInterwikiPrefix which adds an interwiki prefix
  ($wgLocalInterwiki) onto the page names in the UDP feed.
* Added $wgAllowUserSkin to let the wiki's owner disable user selectable skins
  on the wiki. If it's set to false, then the skin used will *always* be
  $wgDefaultSkin.
* Added $wgEnotifUseRealName, which allows UserMailer to send out e-mails based
  on the user's real name if one is set. Defaults to false (use the username)
* Removed the 'apiThumbCacheDir' option from $wgForeignFileRepos (only used in
  ForeignAPIRepo)
* (bug 44) Image namespace and accompanying talk namespace renamed to File.
  For backward compatibility purposes, Image still works. External tools may
  need to be updated.
* The constants NS_FILE and NS_FILE_TALK can now be used instead of NS_IMAGE and
  NS_IMAGE_TALK.  The old constants are retained as aliases for compatibility,
  and should still be used in code meant to be compatible with v1.13 or older.
* MediaWiki can be forced to use private IPs forwarded by a proxy server by
  using $wgUsePrivateIPs.
* The 'BeforeWatchlist' hook has been removed due to internal changes in
  Special:Watchlist. 'SpecialWatchlistQuery' should now be used by extensions
  to customize the watchlist database query.

=== Migrated extensions ===
The following extensions are migrated into MediaWiki 1.14:

* Special:DeletedContributions to show deleted user contributions (was
  extension DeletedContributions)
* Special:Log/newusers recording new users (was extension Newuserlog)
* Special:LinkSearch to search for external links (was extension LinkSearch)
* RenderHash
* NoMoveUserPages
* UniversalEditButton

=== New features in 1.14 ===

* New URL syntaxes for Special:ListUsers - 'Special:ListUsers/USER' and
  'Special:ListUsers/GROUP/USER', in addition to the older syntax
  'Special:ListUsers/GROUP' where GROUP is a valid group name.
* Configurable per-namespace and per-page notices for the edit form,
  respectively MediaWiki:Editnotice-# where # is the namespace number, and
  MediaWiki:Editnotice-#-PAGENAME where # is the page's namespace number and
  PAGENAME is the page name minus the namespace prefix.
* (bug 8068) New __INDEX__ and __NOINDEX__ magic words allow user control of
  search engine indexing on a per-article basis.
* Handheld stylesheet options
* Added 'DoEditSectionLink' hook as a cleaner unified version of the old
  'EditSectionLink' and 'EditSectionLinkForOther' hooks.  Note that the
  'EditSectionLinkForOther' hook has been removed, but 'EditSectionLink' is
  run in all cases instead, so extensions using the old hooks should still work
  if they ran roughly the same code for both hooks (as is almost certain).
* Signature (~~~~) "cleaning", i.e. template removal, can be disabled with
  $wgCleanSignatures=false
* Extensions can use the SkinBuildSidebar hook to modify the content of the
  sidebar and add custom portlets to it

  added 'convertlink=no|yes' on GET requests whether have the link titles
  being converted or not
* (bug 14921) Special:Contributions/: add user name to <title>
  Patch by Emufarmers
* Unescape more "safe" characters when producing URLs, for added prettiness
* Introduced a new hook 'SkinAfterContent' that allows extensions to add text
  after the page content and article metadata. Updated all skins and skin
  templates to work with that hook.
* (bug 14929) removeUnusedAccounts.php now supports 'ignore-touched' and
  'ignore-groups'. Patch by Louperivois
* (bug 15127) Work around minor display glitch in Opera.

  so-called GIFAR vulnerability.
* (bug 15141) Give ability to only list protected pages with the cascading
  option enabled on Special:ProtectedPages
* (bug 15157) Special:Watchlist has the same options as Special:Watchlist:

  groups may be added or removed via the Special:UserRights interface.

== MediaWiki 1.13 ==

== Changes since 1.13.2 ==

David Remahl of Apple's Product Security team has identified a number of
security issues in previous releases of MediaWiki. Subsequent analysis by the
MediaWiki development team expanded the scope of these vulnerabilities. The
issues with a significant impact are as follows:

* An XSS vulnerability affecting all MediaWiki installations between 1.13.0 and
  1.13.2. [CVE-2008-5249]
* A local script injection vulnerability affecting Internet Explorer clients for
  all MediaWiki installations with uploads enabled. [CVE-2008-5250]
* A local script injection vulnerability affecting clients with SVG scripting
  capability (such as Firefox 1.5+), for all MediaWiki installations with SVG
  uploads enabled. [CVE-2008-5250]
* A CSRF vulnerability affecting the Special:Import feature, for all MediaWiki
  installations since the feature was introduced in 1.3.0. [CVE-2008-5252]

XSS (cross-site scripting) vulnerabilities allow an attacker to steal an
authorised user's login session, and to act as that user on the wiki. The
authorised user must visit a web page controlled by the attacker in order to
activate the attack. Intranet wikis are vulnerable if the attacker can
determine the intranet URL.

Local script injection vulnerabilities are like XSS vulnerabilities, except
that the attacker must have an account on the local wiki, and there is no
external site involved. The attacker uploads a script to the wiki, which another
user is tricked into executing, with the effect that the attacker is able to act
as the privileged user.

CSRF vulnerabilities allow an attacker to act as an authorised user on the wiki,
but unlike an XSS vulnerability, the attacker can only act as the user in a
specific and restricted way. The present CSRF vulnerability allows pages to be
edited, with forged revision histories. Like an XSS vulnerability, the
authorised user must visit the malicious web page to activate the attack.

These four vulnerabilities are all fixed in this release.

David Remahl also reminded us of some security-related configuration issues:

* By default, MediaWiki stores a backup of deleted images in the images/deleted
  directory. If you do not want these images to be publically accessible, make
  sure this directory is not accessible from the web. MediaWiki takes some steps
  to avoid leaking these images, but these measures are not perfect.
* Set display_errors=off in your php.ini to avoid path disclosure via PHP fatal
  errors. This is the default on most shared web hosts.
* Enabling MediaWiki's debugging features, such as $wgShowExceptionDetails, may
  lead to path disclosure.

Other changes in this release:

* Avoid fatal error in profileinfo.php when not configured.
* Add a .htaccess to deleted images directory for additional protection against
  exposure of deleted files with known SHA-1 hashes on default installations.
* Avoid streaming uploaded files to the user via index.php. This allows
  security-conscious users to serve uploaded files via a different domain, and
  thus client-side scripts executed from that domain cannot access the login
  cookies. Affects Special:Undelete, img_auth.php and thumb.php.
* When streaming files via index.php, use the MIME type detected from the
  file extension, not from the data. This reduces the XSS attack surface.
* Blacklist redirects via Special:Filepath. Such redirects exacerbate any

== MediaWiki 1.12 ==

This is the Winter 2007 quarterly release.

MediaWiki is now using a "continuous integration" development model with
quarterly snapshot releases. The latest development code is always kept
"ready to run", and in fact runs our own sites on Wikipedia.

Release branches will continue to receive security updates for about a year
from first release, but nonessential bugfixes and feature developments
will be made on the development trunk and appear in the next quarterly release.

Those wishing to use the latest code instead of a branch release can obtain
it from source control: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Download_from_SVN

=== Configuration changes in 1.12 ===
* Marking edits as bot edits with Special:Contributions?bot=1 now requires the
  markbotedit permission, rather than the rollback permission previously used.
  This permission is assigned by default to the sysop group.
* MediaWiki now checks if serialized files are out of date. New configuration
  variable $wgCheckSerialized can be set to false to enable old behavior (i.e.
  to not check and assume they are always up to date)
* The rollback permission can now be rate-limited using the normal mechanism.
* New configuration variable $wgExtraLanguageNames
* Behavior of $wgAddGroups and $wgRemoveGroups changed. New behavior:
* * Granting the userrights privilege allows arbitrary changing of rights.
* * Without the userrights privilege, a user will be able to add and/or
     remove the groups specified in $wgAddGroups and $wgRemoveGroups for
     any groups they are in.
* New permission userrights-interwiki for changing user rights on foreign wikis.
* $wgImplicitGroups for groups that are hidden from Special:Listusers, etc.
* $wgAutopromote: automatically promote users who match specified criteria
* $wgGroupsAddToSelf, $wgGroupsRemoveFromSelf: allow users to add or remove
  themselves from specified groups via Special:Userrights.
* When $wgUseTidy has been enabled, PHP's Tidy module is now used if it is
  present, in preference to an external Tidy executable which may or may not
  be present. To force use of external Tidy even when the PHP module is
  available, set $wgTidyInternal to false.


=== New features in 1.12 ===
* (bug 10735) Add a warning for non-descriptive filenames at Special:Upload
* Add {{filepath:}} parser function to get full path to an uploaded file,
  complementing {{fullurl:}} for pages.
* (bug 11136) If using Postgres, search path is explicitly set if wgDBmwschema
  is not set to 'mediawiki', allowing multiple mediawiki instances per user.

* isValidEmailAddr hook added to User method of that name, to allow, e.g., re-
  stricting e-mail addresses to a specific domain

  click it. Existing clear links will fall back to the raw editor, which is
  very easy to clear your watchlist with.

  on Special:Newpages
* LogLine hook added to allow formatting custom entries in Special:Log.

  fails
  because it is part of a blocked range.

  created by another user

* (bug 12486) Protected titles now give a warning for privileged editors.
* (bug 9939) Special:Search now sets focus to search input box when no existing
  search is active
* For Special:Userrights, use GET instead of POST to search for users.
* Allow subpage syntax for Special:Userrights, i.e., Special:Userrights/Name.
* When submitting changes on Special:Userrights, show the full form again, not
  just the search box.

* (bug 11897) Add alias [[Special:CreateAccount]] & [[Special:Userlogin/signup]]
  for Special:Userlogin?type=signup
* (bug 12214) Add a predefined list of delete reasons to the file deletion form

== Parser changes in 1.12 ==

For help with migration to the MediaWiki 1.12 parser, please visit:

http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Migration_to_the_new_preprocessor

The parser pass order has changed from

   * Extension tag strip and render
   * HTML normalisation and security
   * Template expansion
   * Main section...

to

   * Template and extension tag parse to intermediate representation
   * Template expansion and extension rendering
   * HTML normalisation and security
   * Main section...

The main effect of this for the user is that the rules for uncovered syntax
have changed.

Uncovered main-pass syntax, such as HTML tags, are now generally valid, whereas
previously in some cases they were escaped. For example, you could have "<ta" in
one template, and "ble>" in another template, and put them together to make a
valid <table> tag. Previously the result would have been "&lt;table&gt;".

Uncovered preprocessor syntax is generally not recognised. For example, if you
have "{{a" in Template:A and "b}}" in Template:B, then "{{a}}{{b}}" will be
converted to a literal "{{ab}}" rather than the contents of Template:Ab. This
was the case previously in HTML output mode, and is now uniformly the case in
the other modes as well. HTML-style comments uncovered by template expansion
will not be recognised by the preprocessor and hence will not prevent template
expansion within them, but they will be stripped by the following HTML security
pass.

Bug 5678 has been fixed. This has a number of user-visible effects related to
the removal of this double-parse. Please see the wiki page for examples.

Message transformation mode has been removed, and replaced with "preprocess"
mode. This means that some MediaWiki namespace messages may need to be updated,
especially ones which took advantage of the terribly counterintuitive behavior
of the former message mode.

The header identification routines for section edit and for numbering section
edit links have been merged. This removes a significant failure mode and fixes a
whole category of bugs (tracked by bug #4899). Wikitext headings uncovered by
template expansion will still be rendered into a heading tag, and will get an
entry in the TOC, but will not have a section edit link. HTML-style headings
will also not have a section edit link. Valid wikitext headings present in the
template source text will get a template section edit link. This is a major
break from previous behavior, but I believe the effects are almost entirely
beneficial.

The main motivation for making these changes was performance. The new two-pass
preprocessor can skip "dead branches" in template expansion, such as unfollowed
#switch cases and unused defaults for template arguments. This provides a
significant performance improvement in template-heavy test cases taken from
Wikipedia. Parser function hooks can participate in this performance improvement
by using the new SFH_OBJECT_ARGS flag during registration.

The pre-expand include size limit has been removed, since there's no efficient
way to calculate such a figure, and it would now be meaningless for performance
anyway. The "preprocessor node count" takes its place, with a generous default
limit.

The context in which XML-style extension tags are called has changed, so
extensions which make use of the parser state may need compatibility changes.

The new preprocessor syntax has been documented in Backus-Naur Form at:

https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Preprocessor_ABNF

The ExpandTemplates extension now has the ability to generate an XML parse
tree from wikitext source. This parse tree corresponds closely to the grammar
documented on that page.

== MediaWiki 1.11 ==

This is the Summer 2007 branch release of MediaWiki.

MediaWiki is now using a "continuous integration" development model with
quarterly snapshot releases. The latest development code is always kept
"ready to run", and in fact runs our own sites on Wikipedia.

Release branches will continue to receive security updates for about a year
from first release, but nonessential bugfixes and feature developments
will be made on the development trunk and appear in the next quarterly release.

Those wishing to use the latest code instead of a branch release can obtain
it from source control: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Download_from_SVN

== Configuration changes since 1.10 ==

* $wgThumbUpright - Adjust width of upright images when parameter 'upright' is
  used
* $wgAddGroups, $wgRemoveGroups - Finer control over who can assign which
  usergroups
* $wgEnotifImpersonal, $wgEnotifUseJobQ - Bulk mail options for large sites

== MediaWiki 1.10 ==

This is the Spring 2007 branch release of MediaWiki.

MediaWiki is now using a "continuous integration" development model with
quarterly snapshot releases. The latest development code is always kept
"ready to run", and in fact runs our own sites on Wikipedia.

Release branches will continue to receive security updates for about a year
from first release, but nonessential bugfixes and feature developments
will be made on the development trunk and appear in the next quarterly release.

Those wishing to use the latest code instead of a branch release can obtain
it from source control: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Download_from_SVN

== Configuration changes ==

* A new switch $wgCommandLineDarkBg used by maintenance scripts (parserTests.php).
  It lets you specify if your terminal use a dark background, the colorized
  output will be made lighter making things easier to read.
* The minimum permissions needed to edit a page in each namespace can now be
  customized via the $wgNamespaceProtection array. By default, editing pages in
  the MediaWiki namespace requires "editinterface" permission, as before.
* Allow restriction of autoconfirmed permission by edit count. New global setting
  $wgAutoConfirmCount (defaulting to zero, naturally).
* Added rate limiter for Special:Emailuser
* Private logs can now be created using $wgLogRestrictions
* (Bug 8590) limited HTML is now always enabled ($wgUserHtml = true).

  into a page protected with this option enabled

  overridden by adding diffonly=1 or diffonly=0 to the URL of the diff page

  format as block expiry dates. Existing protections are assumed to be infinite,
  as are protections made with the new field left blank.

  keywords
* (bug 6987) Allow perrow, widths, and heights attributes for <gallery>

  be disabled in other languages too (e.g. if the user specifies uselang=fr).
* Sort log types in Special:Log
* Added a classname ("mw-toolbar-editbutton") and unique IDs to the edit
  toolbar buttons

  to forestall additional UTF-7-autodetect XSS issues. PHP sends only
  'text/html' by default when the script didn't specify more details,
  which some inconsiderate browsers consider a license to autodetect
  the deadly, hard-to-escape UTF-7.
    This fixes an issue with the Ajax interface error message on MSIE when
  $wgUseAjax is enabled (not default configuration); this UTF-7 variant
  on a previously fixed attack vector was discovered by Moshe BA from BugSec:
  http://www.bugsec.com/articles.php?Security=24
* Trackback responses now specify XML content type
* (bug 9044) Send a comment with action=raw pages in CSS/JS output mode

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.10 requires PHP 5 (5.1 recommended). PHP 4 is no longer supported.

PHP 5.0.x fails on 64-bit systems due to serious bugs with array processing:
http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=34879
Upgrade affected systems to PHP 5.1 or higher.

MySQL 3.23.x is no longer supported; some older hosts may need to upgrade.
At this time we still recommend 4.0, but 4.1/5.0 will work fine in most cases.


== Upgrading ==

1.10 has several database changes since 1.9, and will not work without schema
updates.

If upgrading from before 1.7, you may want to run refreshLinks.php to ensure
new database fields are filled with data.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, some major database
changes are made, and there is a slightly higher chance that things could
break. Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.

= MediaWiki release notes =

Security reminder: MediaWiki does not require PHP's register_globals
setting since version 1.2.0. If you have it on, turn it *off* if you can.

  The link leads to a "Show Changes" page showing what will be done to undo the
  edit.
* Fix display of link in "already rolled back" message for image/category pages
* (bug 6016) Left-aligned images should stack vertically, like right-aligned
  images, not horizontally.

* (bug 8083) Applied patch for sk localisation
* Add a backslash character to the edit token, to prevent edits via certain
  broken proxies that mangle such characters in form submissions
* (bug 7461) Allow overwriting pages using importTextFile.php
* (bug 7946) importTextFile.php doesn't perform pre-save transform
* (bug 8117) {{REVISIONTIMESTAMP}} showed weird default if $wgLocalTZoffset set;
  now uses current time for previews and if timestamp can't be loaded from DB
* {{REVISIONTIMESTAMP}} now uses site local timezone instead of user timezone
  to ensure consistent behavior

  to be switched on and off ($wgBreakFrames). Off by default.

* Removed a redundant <strong> tag from diff pages that was causing display issues for some users
* (bug 8203) The keyboard shortcut for "log out" was removed, because users were pressing it
  when they intended to press the shortcut for "preview".

  buffers for HTTP 304 responses, StreamFile, and Special:Export.
  Duplicated code merged into wfResetOutputBuffers() and wfClearOutputBuffers()
* Special:AllPages : 'next page' link now point to the first title of the next
  chunk instead of pointing to the last title of current chunk.
* (bug 4673) Special:AllPages : add a 'previous' link (new message 'prevpage')
* (bug 8121) wfRandom() was not between 0 and 1
* Add static method Parser::createAssocArgs($args), so parser functions can
  use the same code to parse arguments as the templates do.
* Change behavior of logins using the temporary e-mailed password (as stored
  in user_newpassword hash field). Instead of just logging in silently and
  leaving the previous user_password field in place indefinitely, the user
  is now prompted to set a new password.

  The password-changing form is at Special:Resetpass; currently it's only
  usable for changing from the temporary password during login, but it
  could perhaps be generalized, replacing the subform in preferences.

  Once the new password is set successfully, the temporary password is wiped
  so it cannot be used to login a second time, and the login process
  is completed.
* Suppress 'mail new password' button on login form if $wgAuth forbids
  changing user passwords; it wouldn't work very well...
* Consolidate password length checks and $wgAuth manipulation into
  User::setPassword() to avoid duplicate code in different places
  that set passwords.
* User::setPassword() now throws PasswordError exceptions if the password
  is illegal or cannot be set via $wgAuth. These can be caught and a human-
  readable error message displayed by UI code.
* Added Title::isSubpage()
* (bug 8241) Don't consider user pages of User:Foo.css to be CSS subpages
* Set an explicit class on framed thumbnail inner divs and images, changed some
  CSS to use these instead of using descendent selectors.
* Accept null parameter to User::setPassword() as indicating the password
  field should be cleared to an unusable state. Login will only be possible
  after the password is reset, for instance by e-mail.
* (bug 6394) Invalidate the password set for "by e-mail" account creations
  to avoid accidental empty password creations.
* Made the show change size function work on page moves, page creations, and
  log entries. Also fixed it in the javascript recentchanges.
* (bug 8239) correctly get 50 new contributions when clicking '(50 next)'
* (bug 2259) Fix old regression where e-mail addresses were no longer
  confirmed on login with mailed password.
* Add a notification about the confirmation mail sent during account
  creation, so people don't immediately go off to request a second one.
* Add a warning on Special:Confirmemail if a code was already sent and has
  not yet expired.
* Add user_editcount field to provide data for heuristics on account use.
  Incremented on edit, with lazy initialization from past revision data.
  Can batch-initialize with maintenance/initEditCount.php (not yet friendly
  to replication environments, this will do all accounts in one query).
* Allow raw SQL subsections in Database::update() SET portion as well as
  for WHERE portion. Handy for increments and such.
* User::getOption now accept a default value to override default user values
  this makes it consistent with WebRequest::get* methods. Corrected code in
  various places accordingly.
* (bug 8264) Fix JavaScript global vars for XHTML mode
* Make $wgSiteNotice value wikitext again, for consistency with editable
  MediaWiki:Sitenotice and MediaWiki:Anonnotice.
* (bug 8044) When redirecting from the canonical name of the special page
  to the localised one, parameters/subpages are omitted
* (bug 8164) Special:Booksources should use GET for form submission

  pages I create" options now accessible under "Watchlist" options
* (bug 8153) <nowiki> doesn't work in site notice
* (bug 6690) wfMsgNoTrans() transforms messages
* (bug 8274) Wrap edit tools in a <div> with a specified class

  mysteriously otherwise (detection code copied from install-utils.inc)
* (bug 8295) Change handling of <center> tags in doBlockLevels() to match that
  of <div>
* (bug 8110) Make magic ISBN linking stricter: only match ten-digit sequences
  (plus optional ISBN-13 prefix) with no immediately following alphanumeric
  character, disallow multiple consecutive internal redirects
* (bug 2785) Accept optional colon prefix in links when formatting comments
* Don't show "you can view and copy the source of this page" message for
  pages which don't exist
* (bug 8310) Blank line added to top of 'post' when page is blank
* (bug 8109) Template parameters ignored in "recentchangestext"
* Gracefully skip redirect-to-fragment on WebKit versions less than 420;
  it messes up on current versions of Safari but is ok in the latest
  nightlies. Checking the version number will allow it to automatically
  work when new releases of Safari appear.
* Fix regression in thumb styles; size and padding didn't match with
  new arrangement.
* (bug 8333) Fix quick user data update on login password change on
  replication database setups. User data is now pulled from master
  instead of slave in User::loadFromDatabase, ensuring that it is
  fresh and accurate when read and then saved back into cache.
  This was breaking with the Special:Rename operation which
  automatically logs the user in with the new password after changing
  it; pulling from slave meant the record was often not the updated
  one.
* (bug 8335) Set image width to the first valid parameter found.

* (bug 6603) When warning about invalid file extensions, output the bit
  of the extension we actually checked

  with MySQL's strict mode, often enabled by the Windows installer.
  The defaults are ignored anyway when strict mode is off...

  for better compatibility with MySQL's strict mode
* Update default interwiki values to reflect changed location of ursine:
* (bug 5411) Remove autopatrol preference
* Users who have the "autopatrol" permission will have their edits marked as
  patrolled automatically
* Users who do not have the "autopatrol" permission will no longer be able
  to mark their own edits as patrolled
* Introduce 'PingLimiter' hook; see docs/hooks.txt for more information

* (bug 371) Remove alt text for "Enlarge" icon on thumbnails
* Initialize user_editcount to 0 instead of NULL for newly created accounts
* (bug 3696) Strip LRM and RLM characters from titles to work around the
  problem some people have where titles cut-and-pasted from lists include
  the bidi override characters appended to the lists.
  A more thorough blacklist for forbidden and translatable characters would
  be wise, though, as might a cleaner method for the lists in the first place.
* Fix regression in email password resets on read-restricted sites
* Set tabindex on fields in deletion form so you don't have to tab through
  the links in the sitenotice
* (bug 8271) Show full time and date on viewer for individual deleted
  revisions

* (bug 7612) Remove superfluous link to Special:Categories from result items
  on Special:Mostcategories
* {{PLURAL:}} now handles formatted numbers correctly
* (bug 8331) Added the change size value to watchlists; therefore made
  watchlists use RecentChange::newFromRow() instead of newFromCurRow()
* (bug 8351) Fix undo for simple reverts
* (bug 6856) User::clearNotification() does not respect read-only mode
* (bug 6853) Use a checkbox on the installer form to indicate that a superuser
  account should be used; this is clearer than the old check which relied on
  the password never being an obscure value
* Remove old unused watchlist cache, which was a leftover from the old schema
  where watchlists were more expensive to generate
* Minor cosmetic changes to Special:Userrights
* Added wgCanonicalSpecialPageName to JavaScript variables

* Added basic parser tests for language variants
* Enable selflinks and categories to be written in some of the language variants
* Prevent conversion of JavaScript code in language variants
* Output software version number in maintenance/parserTests.php
* (bug 7169) Use Ajax to watch/unwatch articles if enabled
* Make variant table caching a little more robust, using main language code
  in cache key. Probably this is still a bit wonky, though. Was breaking
  parser tests when Chinese tables were getting loaded into Serbian code.
* (bug 8380) Be nicer about blank lines in deleteBatch.php
* (bug 8401) Fix regression in SORBS lookup for some DNS setups
* Use raw file descriptor in posix_isatty() check to avoid warning on
  Linux systems with at least some versions of PHP

  template list. Patch by Fyren, with i18n naming tweak.
* Fix for interwiki transclusion where target wiki uses query string for title
* Resolve namespaces on interwiki Title objects using canonical namespace names
  if possible (should not happen, though, outside interwiki transclusion... and
  maybe not even then, but it does)
* (bug 8447) Fix SQL typo breaking non-default $wgHitcounterUpdateFreq
* Do not allow previews of deleted images to be cached
* Add global variable $wgDefaultLanguageVariant used to set the default language
  variant of a wiki to something different than the main language code

  preferred, utilize it for more parser tests of language variants code
* (bug 6503) Fix bug that stopped certain irrelevant links from being hidden
  for printing
* Avoid PHP warning in Creative Commons metadata when a creative commons
  license is not actually set up

== 1.8 Compatibility changes ==

=== Zend Optimizer ===

A bug in some versions of PHP 5 and Zend Optimizer which was triggered under
MediaWiki 1.8.x has been worked around by disabling some internal debugging
features when Zend Optimizer is loaded. This should solve some common
"blank page" problems.

=== PHP 5.0 64-bit ===

MediaWiki now checks for a condition where PHP 5.0.x corrupts array data
on 64-bit systems and warns you to upgrade PHP to solve the problem. This
bug causes Special: pages to fail on affected systems under MediaWiki 1.8
and higher, and subtler data corruption on earlier versions.

The only known workaround is to upgrade PHP to 5.1 or later, which you
probably should do anyway for security reasons!

=== MySQL 5 ===

MediaWiki should now install and run correctly on MySQL 5.0 and higher when
MySQL's "strict mode" is enabled. (This is now the default for many Windows
installations, though it seems to remain off by default on Unix.)

This fixes errors about "cannot default default value for BLOB/TEXT fields".

=== ImageMagick ===

Note that ImageMagick older than 6.x may no longer work for image resizing
due to use of the -thumbnail option.


== 1.8 Behavior changes ==

=== Localized special pages ===

The names of Special: pages can now be localized, so links and URLs to them
are more legible in languages that aren't English.

Not all languages have included localized names yet.

=== E-mail password ===

Users are now required to set a new password for themselves when they first
log in with a newly generated e-mailed password.

Requesting passwords frequently is prevented to reduce abusive mailbombing.

=== Undo revision ===

An "undo" link now appears in diff view for easier reverting of older edits.
When GNU diff3 is available for edit conflict merging, this can make it much
easier to "undo" the changes of an older edit when there are surrounding
changes elsewhere in the page.

The changes must be manually reviewed and approved, as with conventional
full-revision reverts.

=== Blocking ===

User blocks can be set to disable the automatic blocking of IP addresses the
account logs in with.


== 1.8 Database changes ==

* new 'redirect' table stores data on page redirects
* new 'querycachetwo' table used for some cached special pages
* 'ipblocks' table adds 'ipb_enable_autoblock'
* 'recentchanges' table adds 'rc_old_len', 'rc_new_len' for size tracking
* 'user' table has added 'user_newpass_time' and 'user_editcount' fields
* some indexes have been updated on 'recentchanges'

== 1.8 Configuration changes ==

Several configuration options have changed since 1.8:

=== $wgEnableAPI ===

The experimental machine API interface is now enabled by default, read-only.
You can disable it by setting $wgEnableAPI = false; in LocalSettings.php.

=== $wgPathInfo ===

The use of PATH_INFO (the text after the script name in 'index.php/Blah')
is controlled by the $wgUsePathInfo setting. This is now explicitly disabled
for CGI, apache2filter, and ISAPI configurations of PHP, for more consistency
with the autodetection from the installer.

In some rarer configurations you may have to switch $wgUsePathInfo from false
to true or, perhaps, from true to false to make things work properly if bad
PATH_INFO data comes through the server.

The wiki now tries to detect this condition and should show you an error
message describing what to change instead of sending the browser into an
infinite redirect loop.

=== $wgScript and other path settings ===

The following configuration variables are now automatically set in Setup.php
if they are not overridden in LocalSettings.php:

from $wgScriptPath:
 + $wgScript
 |  \- $wgArticlePath
 + $wgRedirectScript
 + $wgStylePath
 + $wgUploadPath
    \- $wgLogo
     + $wgMathPath

from $IP:
 - $wgStyleDirectory
 + $wgUploadDirectory
   \- $wgMathDirectory
    + $wgTmpDirectory

Newly generated configuration files will by default include only $wgScriptPath
(hardcoded from the installer) and $IP (detected at runtime).

Old configuration files which specify all these values explicitly should
continue to work just fine, but if you use the defaults you can remove them
to reduce clutter.

=== $wgGroupPermissions ===

The sysop group now holds the "autopatrol" and "ipblock-exempt" rights by
default.

"autopatrol" replaces the preference for marking ones own edits patrolled
by default; users holding this permission will automatically have their
edits patrolled, while others cannot mark their own edits as patrolled
even if they have patrolling rights.

"ipblock-exempt" excludes the user from IP blocks; accounts which are blocked
explicitly by name will still be blocked, however. This is given to sysops
to minimize annoyance from accidental "collateral damage"; remember that a
sysop will be able to lift the block if they desire.

The bot group now holds the "nominornewtalk" right. A user with this right
will not trigger new message notifications when making minor edits to user
talk pages. This is meant to minimize annoyance from maintenance bot
processes.

=== $wgUseWatchlistCache ===

Watchlist caching has been removed. The feature was not maintained, and has
been unnecessary since switching to the 'recentchanges' database table
reduced server pressure for Wikipedia's watchlists.

=== $wgBreakFrames ===

MediaWiki in the past attempted to detect when it was embedded in a frameset
and "break out" of it, assuming it to be hostile.

This behavior is now disabled by default, but can be reenabled by setting
$wgBreakFrames to true in LocalSettings.php.


== 1.8 New settings ==

=== $wgVariantArticlePath ===

For languages with script variant support (Chinese, Serbian, and others),
it's possible to use alternate URL paths to select the variant for article
display, setting $wgVariantArticlePath.

Documentation for this setting would be useful.

=== $wgMaxMsgCacheEntrySize ===

The message cache can now skip items larger than a given size; this allows
it to better handle the primary caching case when large CSS and JS blobs are
present.

=== $wgStyleVersion ===

When making significant changes to skin stylesheets and JavaScript files,
you can append a string to this variable to tweak the generated URLs,
forcing newly rendered pages to bring in a fresh version despite server-
or browser-side caching.

Normally this will be set in the course of MediaWiki development, but
if doing development on a custom skin you may wish to poke it as well.

=== $wgRCShowChangedSize ===

Special:Recentchanges and Special:Watchlist now show the number of bytes
added or removed to an article to give an idea of the size of the edit.
This information was previously available only in the IRC update feeds.

To disable this site-wide, set $wgRCShowChangedSize to false.
(Individual users can suppress the data in custom CSS.)

Adjust $wgRCChangedSizeThreshold to trigger highlighting of particularly
large changes.

The formatting of the size figure can be adjusted through the
[[MediaWiki:Rc-change-size]] message.

=== $wgQueryCacheLimit ===

The number of rows stored for "expensive" special pages in miser mode
can now be adjusted up or down from the default 1000.

=== $wgDisableQueryPageUpdate ===

Individual "expensive" special pages can be skipped in processing by
updateSpecialPages if added to this list.

=== $wgSorbsUrl ===

The base hostname for the DNS-based proxy blacklist can now be overridden
when $wgEnableSorbs is set, to use a different blacklist instead of SORBS.
The blacklist would need to respond the same was as SORBS; any positive
response will be taken as a proxy.

=== $wgAjaxWatch ===

Experimental AJAX mode for the watch/unwatch tabs to execute inline.
Does not include the UI messages describing how to reach the watchlist,
so you may not want it on a general-audience site just yet.

=== $wgParserTestFiles ===

MediaWiki's parser test suite can now be expanded with additional test
files. Custom extensions can add their test files to this array, and
they will be run along with the main tests by maintenance/parserTests.php


== Changes since 1.7 ==

* Introduced AjaxResponse object, superceding AjaxCachePolicy
* Changes to sajax_do_call: optionally accept an element to fill instead of a
  callback function; take the target function or element as a third parameter;
  pass the full XMLHttpRequest object to the handler function, instead of just
  the resultText value; use HTTP response codes to report errors.
* (bug 6562) Removed unmaintained ParserXml.php for now
* History paging overlap bug fixed
* (bug 6586) Regression in "unblocked" subtitle
* Don't put empty-page message into view-source when page text is blank
* (bug 6587) Remove redundant "allnonarticles" message

  or disallow account creation from blocked IP addresses. Prevent duplicate
  blocks. Fixed the problem of expiry and unblocking erroneously affecting
  multiple blocks. Fixed confusing lack of error message when a blocked user
  attempts to create an account. Fixed inefficiency of Special:Ipblocklist in
  the presence of large numbers of blocks; added indexes and implemented an
  indexed pager.
* (bug 6448) Allow filtering of Special:Newpages according to username
* (bug 6618) Improve permissions/error detection in Special:Lockdb
* Quick hack for extension testing: parser test doesn't create new message
  cache object.
* (bug 6299) Maintain parser's revision ID across recursive calls to fix
  {{REVISIONID}} when Cite extension is used
* (bug 6622) Removed deprecated function Image::newFromTitle
* (bug 6627) Fix regression in Special:Ipblocklist with table prefix

  not exist; now doesn't show the source box if the user hasn't provided it
  (blocked mid-edit) and the page doesn't exist

* Added DBA cache type, for BDB-style caches.
* Removed custom date format functions, replacing them with a format string in
  the style of PHP's date(). Used string identifiers instead of integer
  identifiers, in both the language files and user preferences. Migration should
  be transparent in most cases.
* Simplified the initialisation API for LoadBalancer objects.
* Removed the broken altencoding feature.
* Moved default user options and toggles from Language to User. Language objects

  could even result in invalid output from valid input.

== MediaWiki 1.5.8 ==

March 26, 2006

MediaWiki 1.5.8 is a security and bugfix maintenance release.

A bug in decoding of certain encoded links could allow injection of raw
HTML into page output; this could potentially lead to XSS attacks.

Some minor UI fixes were also made, see the change log at the bottom of
this file.


== MediaWiki 1.5.7 ==

March 2, 2006

MediaWiki 1.5.7 is a bugfix maintenance release.

Most importantly, a security issue in the installer has been fixed. The bug
affects new installations of 1.5.6 only. If the user specified the MySQL root
password, to allow the installer to create an unprivileged account, the
installer would not only create the new account but also change the root
password to be equal to the password of the new account.

Anyone affected by this bug will need to change the root password back
manually. For information about how to change passwords in MySQL please see:
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/passwords.html

This version includes fixes for compatibility with Internet Explorer 7
beta 2, and various other bugs; see the full changelog at the end of
the release notes.


== MediaWiki 1.5.6 ==

January 19, 2006

MediaWiki 1.5.6 is a security and bugfix maintenance release.

A bug in edit comment formatting could send PHP into an infinite loop
if certain malformed links were included. In most installations, this
would cause the script to fail after PHP's 30-second failsafe timeout.

Some improvements have been made to the installer which should make
installation possible on a system with a broken MySQL "root" account.

For several other minor fixes, see the complete changelog at the end
of this file.


== MediaWiki 1.5.5 ==

January 5, 2006

MediaWiki 1.5.5 is a security and bugfix maintenance release.

Detection for uploads of Windows Metafile (.wmf) images has been added
to help protect against a client-side vulnerability in unpatched Microsoft
Windows operating systems.

Sites which have enabled uploads and added non-standard file types
(such as .ogg, .doc, or .pdf) should upgrade to this release to ensure
that malicious .wmf files can't be uploaded with a fake extension;
such files could put visitors to the site at risk.

For more details on this, see:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Metafile_vulnerability

Additionally, a maintenance script removeUnusedAccounts.php has been added;
this replaces an older Perl script which had not been updated for the new
schema in 1.5.


== MediaWiki 1.5.4 ==

December 21, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5.4 is a security and bugfix maintenance release.

A hardcoded internal placeholder string has been replaced with a random
one. This closes a hole where security checks in inline style attributes
could be bypassed, injecting JavaScript code that could execute in
Microsoft Internet Explorer.

Other browsers would not be vulnerable.

Several minor fixes are included in this release, most notably a fix
to clear the "you have new messages" flag properly for usernames
containing spaces when e-mail notification is enabled.

See the changelog at the end of the release notes for a full list of
fixes.


== MediaWiki 1.5.3 ==

December 4, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5.3 is a security and bugfix maintenance release.

Validation of the user language option was broken by a code change in
May 2005, opening the possibility of remote code execution as this
parameter is used in forming a class name dynamically created with
eval().

The validation has been corrected in this version. All prior 1.5 release
and prelease versions are affected; 1.4 and earlier and not affected.

Additionally several bugs have been fixed; see the changelog later in
this file for a complete list.


== MediaWiki 1.5.2 ==

November 2, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5.2 is a bugfix maintenance release.

A change in PHP 4.4.1 and PHP 5.1.0RC broke handling of extension and
<pre> sections, causing garbage data to be inserted in output and saved
edits. This version works around the change.

Several other glitches with MySQL 5.0 and PHP 5.0.5 were also fixed;
see the change log below for a complete list.


== MediaWiki 1.5.1 ==

October 26, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5.1 is a bugfix and security maintenance release, and is a
recommended upgrade for all installations.

This release includes further corrections to the inline CSS style sanitation
which works around a JavaScript "feature" on Microsoft Internet Explorer.
Users of Microsoft Internet Explorer for Windows may be vulnerable to
XSS injections on prior versions; users of standards-compliant browsers
are not vulnerable.

Major fixes include:
* Image pages work again with resizing disabled
* Works in MySQL 5.0 strict mode

There is experimental support in this release for explicitly declaring
the UTF-8 charset in the database; this has been tested with MySQL 5.0.15
but should work on 4.1 as well.

IMPORTANT: Changing this setting on an existing wiki may produce interesting
data corruption, depending on server configuration. Page contents should,
usually, be unaffected, but page titles and other items may be. Limitations
in MySQL's Unicode support mean that characters outside the BMP cannot be used
in page titles or various other fields when using this mode.

Table definitions are in maintenance/mysql5/tables.sql, and the runtime
option to send 'SET NAMES utf8' is set by $wgDBmysql5 = true.

(MySQL 3.23.x and 4.0.x do not support character set declarations; on these
versions MediaWiki simply works with UTF-8 data and MySQL is blissfully
unaware of it.)



== MediaWiki 1.5.0 final ==

October 5, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5.0 is the new stable release branch of MediaWiki, and is
recommended for all new installations.

Any wikis running a 1.5 beta or release candidate are strongly recommended
to upgrade to the final release, which includes a number of bug fixes and
a security fix for CSS bugs in Microsoft Internet Explorer.

IMPORTANT: Running a 1.3 or 1.4 wiki and don't want to jump to 1.5 yet?
Be sure to upgrade to 1.3.17 or 1.4.11, also released today. Versions
prior to 1.3.16 and 1.4.10 have a serious data corruption bug which is
triggered by a spambot known to operate in the wild.


=== What's new in 1.5? ===

Schema:
  The core table schema has changed significantly. This should make better
  use of the database's cache and disk I/O, and make significantly speed up
  rename and delete operations on pages with very long edit histories.

  Unfortunately this does mean upgrading a wiki of size from 1.4 will require
  some downtime for the schema restructuring, but future storage backend
  changes should be able to integrate into the new system more easily.

Permalinks:
  The current revision of a page now has a permanent 'oldid' number assigned
  immediately, and the id numbers are now preserved across deletion/undeletion.
  A permanent reference to the current revision of a page is now just a matter
  of going to the 'history' tab and copying the first link in the list.

Page move log:
  Renames of pages are now recorded in Special:Log and the page history.
  A handy revert link is available from the log for sysops.

Editing diff:
  Ever lost track of what you'd done so far during an edit? A 'Show diff'
  button on the edit page now makes it easy to remember.

Uploads:
  It's now possible to specify the final filename of an upload distinct
  from the original filename on your disk.

  An image link for a missing file will now take you straight to the upload page.

  More metadata is pre-extracted from uploaded images, which will ease pressure
  on disk or NFS volumes used to store images. EXIF metadata is displayed on
  the image description page if PHP is configured with the necessary module.

  If .svg files are added to the upload whitelist, you can choose to render
  them to rasterized .png images for inline display using one of several
  external helper programs. See DefaultSettings.php for SVG options.

User accounts:
  There are some changes to the user permissions system, with assignable
  groups. Note that this does *not* allow you to make pages which are only
  accessible to certain groups.

  For details see: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:User_rights

E-mail:
  User-to-user e-mail can now be restricted to require a mail-back confirmation
  first to reduce potential for abuse with false addresses.

  Updates to user talk pages and watchlist entries can optionally send e-mail
  notifications.

External hooks:
  A somewhat experimental interface for hooking in an external editor
  application is included.

And...
  A bunch of stuff we forgot to mention.


=== What's gone? ===

Latin-1:
  Wikis must now be encoded in Unicode UTF-8; this has been the default for
  some time, but some languages could optionally be installed in Latin-1 mode.
  This is no longer supported.

  You can check if your current wiki is in Latin-1 mode by using your browser's
  "view source"; look for a line like this:

    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />

  If it says charset=utf-8, you're ready. If it says charset=iso8859-1,
  you may need to convert your data. (English-language wikis avoiding
  any accented characters may be able to get away without conversion.)

MySQL 3.x:
  Some optimization hacks for MySQL 3.x have been removed as part of the schema
  clean-up (specifically, the inverse_timestamp fields).

  MediaWiki 1.5 may still run on 3.x, but wikis of non-trivial size should
  very seriously consider upgrading to a more modern release. MySQL 3.x support
  will probably be entirely dropped in the next major release.

Special:Maintenance
  These tools were, ironically enough, not really maintained. This special
  page has been removed; insofar as some of its pieces were useful and haven't
  already been supplanted by other special pages they should be rewritten in
  an efficient and safe manner in the future.


=== Caveats ===

Upgrade:
  Wikis in Latin-1 encoding are no longer supported; only Unicode UTF-8.
  A new option $wgLegacyEncoding is provided to allow on-the-fly recoding of
  old page text entries, but other metadata fields (titles, comments etc) need
  to be pre-converted. The standard upgrade process does not yet fully automate
  this, but you can try the alternate partial-upgrader in upgrade1_5.php.

  The upgrade from 1.4 to 1.5 schema has not been tested for all cases, so
  it's possible you may experience problems in some combinations.

Backups:
  The text entries of deleted pages are no longer removed from the main
  text table on deletion. If you provide public backup dumps of your databases,
  you will probably want to use the new XML-format dump generator, available
  as maintenance/dumpBackup.php.

  For more information on how we run our own public data dumps at Wikimedia,
  see http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Data_dumps

PostgreSQL:
  The table definitions for PostgreSQL install are out of date. PostgreSQL
  support may return in later releases, pending appropriate patches.

MySQL 4.1+:
  Some users may encounter installation problems with MySQL 4.1 or higher
  due to strange charset encoding / collation configurations. Try setting
  to 'latin1' or 'utf8' if you encounter problems.



== MediaWiki 1.5 release candidate 4 ==

August 29, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5rc4 is a preview release of the new 1.5 release series.
It fixes compatibility with PHP 5.1, and corrects two cross-site scripting
security bugs:

* <math> tags were handled incorrectly when TeX rendering support is off,
  as in the default configuration.
* Extension or <nowiki> sections in Wiki table syntax could bypass HTML
  style attribute restrictions for cross-site scripting attacks against
  Microsoft Internet Explorer

Wikis where the optional math support has been *enabled* are not vulnerable
to the first, but are vulnerable to the second.



== MediaWiki 1.5 release candidate 3 ==

August 24, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5rc3 is a preview release of the new 1.5 release series.
It fixes several major problems in 1.5rc2:

* Fixed a cross-site scripting injection in the search form
  (broken since 1.5beta1)

* Fixed upgrades from 1.4 database schema
  (broken since 1.5rc2)

1.3 and 1.4 releases are not vulnerable to the XSS bug, but anyone
running an earlier 1.5 beta or release candidate should upgrade
immediately.


== MediaWiki 1.5 release candidate 2 ==

August 23, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5rc2 is a preview release of the new 1.5 release series.
Numerous bug fixes since last beta, plus a security fix; see change
log below for full details.

A flaw in the interaction between extensions and HTML attribute
sanitization was discovered which could allow unauthorized use
of offsite resources in style sheets, and possible exploitation
of a JavaScript injection feature on Microsoft Internet Explorer.

This version expands the returned text and properly checks it
before output.

A 1.5rc1 release was mistakenly made from the incorrect source code
branch; 1.5rc2 is identical to the actual 1.5rc1 in revision control
except for version number.


== MediaWiki 1.5 beta 4 ==

July 30, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5 beta 4 is a preview release of the new 1.5 release series.
A number of bugs have been fixed since beta 3; see the full changelist below.


== MediaWiki 1.5 beta 3 ==

July 7, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5 beta 3 is a preview release of the new 1.5 release
series, with a security update over beta 2.

Incorrect escaping of a parameter in the page move template could
be used to inject JavaScript code by getting a victim to visit a
maliciously constructed URL. Users of vulnerable releases are
recommended to upgrade to this release.

Vulnerable versions:
* 1.5 preview series: n <= 1.5beta2 vulnerable, fixed in 1.5beta3
* 1.4 stable series: 1.4beta6 <= n <= 1.4.5 vulnerable, fixed in 1.4.6
* 1.3 legacy series: not vulnerable

This release also includes several bug fixes and localization updates.
See the changelog at the end of this file for a detailed list.



== MediaWiki 1.5 beta 2 ==

July 5, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5 beta 2 is a preview release of the new 1.5 release series.
While most exciting new bugs should have been ironed out at this point,
third-party wiki operators should probably not run this beta release
on a public site without closely following additional development.

Anyone who _has_ been running beta 1 is very very strongly advised to
upgrade to beta 2, as it fixes many bugs from the previous beta including
a couple of HTML and SQL injections.

This release should be followed by one or two release candidates and
a 1.5.0 final within the next few weeks.

Beta upgraders, note there are some minor database changes. For upgrades
from 1.4, see the file UPGRADE for details on significant database and
configuration file changes.

Beta 2 includes a preliminary command-line XML wiki dump importer tool,
maintenance/importDump.php, paired with maintenance/dumpBackup.php.
These use the same format as Special:Export and Special:Import, able
to package a wiki's entire page set independent of the backend database
and compression format.


== MediaWiki 1.5 beta 1 ==

June 26, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5 beta 1 is a preview release, pretty much feature complete,
of the new 1.5 release series. There are several known and likely a number
of unknown bugs; it is not recommended to use this release in a production
environment but would be recommended for testing in mind of an upcoming
deployment.

A number of significant changes have been made since the alpha releases,
including database changes and a reworking of the user permissions settings.
See the file UPGRADE for details of upgrading and changing your prior
configuration settings for the new system.



== MediaWiki 1.5 alpha 2 ==

June 3, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5 alpha 2 includes a lot of bug fixes, feature merges,
and a security update.

Incorrect handling of page template inclusions made it possible to
inject JavaScript code into HTML attributes, which could lead to
cross-site scripting attacks on a publicly editable wiki.

Vulnerable releases and fix:
* 1.5 prerelease: fixed in 1.5alpha2
* 1.4 stable series: fixed in 1.4.5
* 1.3 legacy series: fixed in 1.3.13
* 1.2 series no longer supported; upgrade to 1.4.5 strongly recommended


== MediaWiki 1.5 alpha 1 ==

May 3, 2005

This is a testing preview release, being put out mainly to aid testers in
finding installation bugs and other major problems. It is strongly recommended
NOT to run a live production web site on this alpha release.

**  WARNING: USE OF THIS ALPHA RELEASE MAY INFEST YOUR HOUSE WITH  **
**  TERMITES, ROT YOUR TEETH,  GROW HAIR ON YOUR PALMS, AND PASTE  **
**  INNUENDO  INTO  YOUR  C.V.  RIGHT  BEFORE  A  JOB  INTERVIEW!  **
**  DON'T SAY WE DIDN'T WARN YOU, MAN. WE TOTALLY DID RIGHT HERE.  **

Some output, particularly involving user-supplied inline HTML, may not
produce 100% valid or well-formed XHTML output. Testers are welcome to
set $wgMimeType = "application/xhtml+xml"; to test for remaining problem
cases, but this is not recommended on live sites. (This must be set for
MathML to display properly in Mozilla.)

== MediaWiki 1.4.3 ==

(released 2005-04-28)

MediaWiki 1.4.3 is a bugfix release for the 1.4 stable release series.

Chiefly, this fixes a compatibility problem with PHP 5 and a minor link
table corruption bug on initial page save.


== MediaWiki 1.4.2 ==

(released 2005-04-20)

MediaWiki 1.4.2 is a security and bug fix release for the 1.4 stable release
series.

A cross-site scripting injection vulnerability was discovered, which
affects only MSIE clients and is only open if MediaWiki has been
manually configured to run output through HTML Tidy ($wgUseTidy).

Several other bugs are fixed in this release, see the changelog below.

All new installations are highly recommended to use 1.4.2 instead of
1.3.x; 1.3.x users should consider upgrading for bug fixes and new
features. Ealier 1.4.x release and beta users should upgrade to this
release for relevant bug fixes; see the changelog later in this file.


If you have trouble, remember to read this whole file and the online FAQ page
before asking for help:

https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:FAQ


=== READ THIS FIRST: Upgrading ===

If upgrading from an older release, see the notes in the file UPGRADE.
There are a couple of minor database changes from the beta releases,
and somewhat larger changes from 1.3.x.

Upgrading from a previous 1.4.x stable release installation should
generally only require copying the new files over the old ones.


==== READ THIS FIRST, TOO: MySQL 4.1 AND 5.0 ====

MySQL 5.0 is a beta release, not yet ready for production use. If you
are using it, the notes below about 4.1 apply to you too.

If you have the choice of MySQL 4.0 or MySQL 4.1 and don't need 4.1 for
some other application, you should consider sticking with 4.0 for the
moment. 4.1 may require you to do extra fiddling to get things to work
due to changes that aren't fully backwards-compatible.

MySQL 4.1 has changed the authentication protocol in an incompatible
way; many PHP installations still use the older client libraries and
CANNOT CONNECT TO THE SERVER WITH A PASSWORD without some changes.

See: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/Old_client.html

If MySQL is set with utf-8 as the default character set, installation
may fail with "key too long" errors. Set the default charset to 'latin1'
for installation and it should work.

The mysqldump backup generator now applies an automatic conversion to
UTF-8, which may irretrivably corrupt your data. Pass the -charset option
with the original default charset (eg 'latin1') to skip the conversion.


==== READ THIS FIRST IF RUNNING ON A WINDOWS SERVER ====

MediaWiki is tested and deployed primarily under the Apache web server
on Linux Unix systems. There are known to be problems running on
Microsoft's IIS which are not fully resolved. If you have a choice,
try running under Apache on Windows, or on a Unix/Linux box instead.

If you're having trouble with blank pages on IIS and can't switch,
try the workaround suggested in this bug report:
http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1763


=== New features ===

* 'Recentchanges Patrol' to mark new edits that haven't yet been viewed.
* New, searchable deletion/upload/protection logs
* Image gallery generation (Special:Newimages and <gallery> tag)
* SVG rasterization support (requires external support tools)
* Users can select from the available localizations to override the
  default user interface language.
* Traditional/Simplified Chinese conversion support
* rel="nofollow" support to combat linkspam

The current implementation adds this attribute to _all_ external URL
links in wiki text (but not internal [[wiki links]] or interwiki links).
To disable the attribute for _all_ external links, add this line to your
LocalSettings.php:

  $wgNoFollowLinks = false

For background information on nofollow see:

  http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html


=== Installation and compatibility ===

* The default MonoBook theme now works with PHP 5.0
* Installation on systems with PHP's safe mode or other oddities
  should work more reliably, as MonoBook no longer needs to
  create a compiled template file for the wiki to run.
* A table prefix may be specified, to avoid conflicts with other
  web applications forced to share a database.
* More thorough UTF-8 input validation; fixes non-ASCII uploaded
  filenames from Safari.
* Command-line database upgrade script.


=== Customizability ===

* Default user options can now be overridden in LocalSettings.
* Skins system more modular: templates and CSS are now in /skins/
  New skins can be dropped into this directory and used immediately.
* More extension hooks have been added.
* Authentication plugin hook.
* More internal code documentation, generated with phpdoc:
  https://doc.wikimedia.org/mediawiki-core/master/php/html/


=== Optimization ===

* For many operations, MediaWiki 1.4 should run faster and use
  less memory than MediaWiki 1.3. Page rendering is up to twice
  as fast. (Use a PHP accelerator such as Turck MMCache for best
  results with any PHP application, though!)
* The parser cache no longer requires memcached, and is enabled
  by default. This avoids a lot of re-rendering of pages that
  have been shown recently, greatly speeding longer page views.
* Support for compiled PHP modules to speed up page diff and
  Unicode validation/normalization. (Requires ability to compile
  and load PHP extensions).


=== What isn't ready yet ===

* A new user/groups permissions scheme has been held back to 1.5.
* An experimental SOAP interface will be made available as an extension
* PostgreSQL support is largely working, minus search and the installer.
  You can perform a manual installation.
* E-mail notification of watched page changes and verification of
  user-submitted e-mail addresses is not yet included.
* Log pages are not automatically imported into the new log table
  at upgrade time. A script to import old text log entries is
  incomplete, but may be available in later point releases.
* Some localizations are still incomplete.



== Changelog ==

=== Important security updates ===

A security audit found and fixed a number of problems. Users of MediaWiki
1.3.10 and earlier should upgrade to 1.3.11; users of 1.4 beta releases
prior to 1.4rc1 should upgrade immediately.

==== Cross-site scripting vulnerability ====

XSS injection points can be used to hijack session and authentication
cookies as well as more serious attacks.

* Media: links output raw text into an attribute value, potentially
  abusable for JavaScript injection. This has been corrected.
* Additional checks added to file upload to protect against MSIE and
  Safari MIME-type autodetection bugs.

As of 1.3.10/1.4beta6, per-user customized CSS and JavaScript is disabled
by default as a general precaution. Sites which want this ability may set
$wgAllowUserCss and $wgAllowUserJs in LocalSettings.php.


==== Cross-site request forgery ====

An attacker could use JavaScript-submitted forms to perform various
restricted actions by tricking an authenticated user into visiting
a malicious web page. A fix for page editing in 1.3.10/1.4beta6 has
been expanded in this release to other forms and functions.

Authors of bot tools may need to update their code to include the
additional fields.


==== Directory traversal ====

An unchecked parameter in image deletion could allow an authenticated
administrator to delete arbitary files in directories writable by the
web server, and confirm existence of files not deletable.


==== Older issues ====

Note that 1.4 beta releases prior to beta 5 include an input validation
error which could lead to execution of arbitrary PHP code on the server.
Users of older betas should upgrade immediately to the current version.


Beta 6 also introduces the use of rel="nofollow" attributes on external
links in wiki pages to reduce the effectiveness of wiki spam. This will
cause participating search engines to ignore external URL links from wiki
pages for purposes of page relevancy ranking.

=== Caveats ===

Some output, particularly involving user-supplied inline HTML, may not
produce 100% valid or well-formed XHTML output. Testers are welcome to
set $wgMimeType = "application/xhtml+xml"; to test for remaining problem
cases, but this is not recommended on live sites. (This must be set for
MathML to display properly in Mozilla.)
