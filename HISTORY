  to debugging issues. (Keep this?)
* Use __FILE__ to form path in new LocalSettings.php, so it stays accurate
  when the directory is relocated for typical usage.

  save the normalization for internal link storage. The normalization is a bit
  buggy and can make incorrect foldings in the query string and such, so isn't
  reliable beyond the hostname where it's used for the spam bulk checker.

== MediaWiki 1.5.8 ==

March 26, 2006

MediaWiki 1.5.8 is a security and bugfix maintenance release.

A bug in decoding of certain encoded links could allow injection of raw
HTML into page output; this could potentially lead to XSS attacks.

Some minor UI fixes were also made, see the change log at the bottom of
this file.


== MediaWiki 1.5.7 ==

March 2, 2006

MediaWiki 1.5.7 is a bugfix maintenance release.

Most importantly, a security issue in the installer has been fixed. The bug 
affects new installations of 1.5.6 only. If the user specified the MySQL root 
password, to allow the installer to create an unprivileged account, the 
installer would not only create the new account but also change the root 
password to be equal to the password of the new account. 

Anyone affected by this bug will need to change the root password back 
manually. For information about how to change passwords in MySQL please see:
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/passwords.html

This version includes fixes for compatibility with Internet Explorer 7
beta 2, and various other bugs; see the full changelog at the end of
the release notes.


== MediaWiki 1.5.6 ==

January 19, 2006

MediaWiki 1.5.6 is a security and bugfix maintenance release.

A bug in edit comment formatting could send PHP into an infinite loop
if certain malformed links were included. In most installations, this
would cause the script to fail after PHP's 30-second failsafe timeout.

Some improvements have been made to the installer which should make
installation possible on a system with a broken MySQL "root" account.

For several other minor fixes, see the complete changelog at the end
of this file.


== MediaWiki 1.5.5 ==

January 5, 2006

MediaWiki 1.5.5 is a security and bugfix maintenance release.

Detection for uploads of Windows Metafile (.wmf) images has been added
to help protect against a client-side vulnerability in unpatched Microsoft
Windows operating systems.

Sites which have enabled uploads and added non-standard file types
(such as .ogg, .doc, or .pdf) should upgrade to this release to ensure
that malicious .wmf files can't be uploaded with a fake extension;
such files could put visitors to the site at risk.

For more details on this, see:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Metafile_vulnerability

Additionally, a maintenance script removeUnusedAccounts.php has been added;
this replaces an older Perl script which had not been updated for the new
schema in 1.5.


== MediaWiki 1.5.4 ==

December 21, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5.4 is a security and bugfix maintenance release.

A hardcoded internal placeholder string has been replaced with a random
one. This closes a hole where security checks in inline style attributes
could be bypassed, injecting JavaScript code that could execute in
Microsoft Internet Explorer.

Other browsers would not be vulnerable.

Several minor fixes are included in this release, most notably a fix
to clear the "you have new messages" flag properly for usernames
containing spaces when e-mail notification is enabled.

See the changelog at the end of the release notes for a full list of
fixes.


== MediaWiki 1.5.3 ==

December 4, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5.3 is a security and bugfix maintenance release.

Validation of the user language option was broken by a code change in
May 2005, opening the possibility of remote code execution as this
parameter is used in forming a class name dynamically created with
eval().

The validation has been corrected in this version. All prior 1.5 release
and prelease versions are affected; 1.4 and earlier and not affected.

Additionally several bugs have been fixed; see the changelog later in
this file for a complete list.


== MediaWiki 1.5.2 ==

November 2, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5.2 is a bugfix maintenance release.

A change in PHP 4.4.1 and PHP 5.1.0RC broke handling of extension and
<pre> sections, causing garbage data to be inserted in output and saved
edits. This version works around the change.

Several other glitches with MySQL 5.0 and PHP 5.0.5 were also fixed;
see the change log below for a complete list.


== MediaWiki 1.5.1 ==

October 26, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5.1 is a bugfix and security maintenance release, and is a
recommended upgrade for all installations.

This release includes further corrections to the inline CSS style sanitation
which works around a JavaScript "feature" on Microsoft Internet Explorer.
Users of Microsoft Internet Explorer for Windows may be vulnerable to
XSS injections on prior versions; users of standards-compliant browsers
are not vulnerable.

Major fixes include:
* Image pages work again with resizing disabled
* Works in MySQL 5.0 strict mode

There is experimental support in this release for explicitly declaring
the UTF-8 charset in the database; this has been tested with MySQL 5.0.15
but should work on 4.1 as well.

IMPORTANT: Changing this setting on an existing wiki may produce interesting
data corruption, depending on server configuration. Page contents should,
usually, be unaffected, but page titles and other items may be. Limitations
in MySQL's Unicode support mean that characters outside the BMP cannot be used
in page titles or various other fields when using this mode.

Table definitions are in maintenance/mysql5/tables.sql, and the runtime
option to send 'SET NAMES utf8' is set by $wgDBmysql5 = true.

(MySQL 3.23.x and 4.0.x do not support character set declarations; on these
versions MediaWiki simply works with UTF-8 data and MySQL is blissfully
unaware of it.)



== MediaWiki 1.5.0 final ==

October 5, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5.0 is the new stable release branch of MediaWiki, and is
recommended for all new installations.

Any wikis running a 1.5 beta or release candidate are strongly recommended
to upgrade to the final release, which includes a number of bug fixes and
a security fix for CSS bugs in Microsoft Internet Explorer.

IMPORTANT: Running a 1.3 or 1.4 wiki and don't want to jump to 1.5 yet?
Be sure to upgrade to 1.3.17 or 1.4.11, also released today. Versions
prior to 1.3.16 and 1.4.10 have a serious data corruption bug which is
triggered by a spambot known to operate in the wild.


=== What's new in 1.5? ===

Schema:
  The core table schema has changed significantly. This should make better
  use of the database's cache and disk I/O, and make significantly speed up
  rename and delete operations on pages with very long edit histories.
  
  Unfortunately this does mean upgrading a wiki of size from 1.4 will require
  some downtime for the schema restructuring, but future storage backend
  changes should be able to integrate into the new system more easily.

Permalinks:
  The current revision of a page now has a permanent 'oldid' number assigned
  immediately, and the id numbers are now preserved across deletion/undeletion.
  A permanent reference to the current revision of a page is now just a matter
  of going to the 'history' tab and copying the first link in the list.

Page move log:
  Renames of pages are now recorded in Special:Log and the page history.
  A handy revert link is available from the log for sysops.

Editing diff:
  Ever lost track of what you'd done so far during an edit? A 'Show diff'
  button on the edit page now makes it easy to remember.

Uploads:
  It's now possible to specify the final filename of an upload distinct
  from the original filename on your disk.
  
  An image link for a missing file will now take you straight to the upload page.
  
  More metadata is pre-extracted from uploaded images, which will ease pressure
  on disk or NFS volumes used to store images. EXIF metadata is displayed on
  the image description page if PHP is configured with the necessary module.
  
  If .svg files are added to the upload whitelist, you can choose to render
  them to rasterized .png images for inline display using one of several
  external helper programs. See DefaultSettings.php for SVG options.

User accounts:
  There are some changes to the user permissions system, with assignable
  groups. Note that this does *not* allow you to make pages which are only
  accessible to certain groups.
  
  For details see: http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:User_rights

E-mail:
  User-to-user e-mail can now be restricted to require a mail-back confirmation
  first to reduce potential for abuse with false addresses.
  
  Updates to user talk pages and watchlist entries can optionally send e-mail
  notifications.

External hooks:
  A somewhat experimental interface for hooking in an external editor
  application is included.

And...
  A bunch of stuff we forgot to mention.


=== What's gone? ===

Latin-1:
  Wikis must now be encoded in Unicode UTF-8; this has been the default for
  some time, but some languages could optionally be installed in Latin-1 mode.
  This is no longer supported.
  
  You can check if your current wiki is in Latin-1 mode by using your browser's
  "view source"; look for a line like this:
  
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
  
  If it says charset=utf-8, you're ready. If it says charset=iso8859-1,
  you may need to convert your data. (English-language wikis avoiding
  any accented characters may be able to get away without conversion.)

MySQL 3.x:
  Some optimization hacks for MySQL 3.x have been removed as part of the schema
  clean-up (specifically, the inverse_timestamp fields).
  
  MediaWiki 1.5 may still run on 3.x, but wikis of non-trivial size should
  very seriously consider upgrading to a more modern release. MySQL 3.x support
  will probably be entirely dropped in the next major release.

Special:Maintenance
  These tools were, ironically enough, not really maintained. This special
  page has been removed; insofar as some of its pieces were useful and haven't
  already been supplanted by other special pages they should be rewritten in
  an efficient and safe manner in the future.


=== Caveats ===

Upgrade:
  Wikis in Latin-1 encoding are no longer supported; only Unicode UTF-8.
  A new option $wgLegacyEncoding is provided to allow on-the-fly recoding of
  old page text entries, but other metadata fields (titles, comments etc) need
  to be pre-converted. The standard upgrade process does not yet fully automate
  this, but you can try the alternate partial-upgrader in upgrade1_5.php.
  
  The upgrade from 1.4 to 1.5 schema has not been tested for all cases, so
  it's possible you may experience problems in some combinations.

Backups:
  The text entries of deleted pages are no longer removed from the main
  text table on deletion. If you provide public backup dumps of your databases,
  you will probably want to use the new XML-format dump generator, available
  as maintenance/dumpBackup.php.
  
  For more information on how we run our own public data dumps at Wikimedia,
  see http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Data_dumps

PostgreSQL:
  The table definitions for PostgreSQL install are out of date. PostgreSQL
  support may return in later releases, pending appropriate patches.

MySQL 4.1+:
  Some users may encounter installation problems with MySQL 4.1 or higher
  due to strange charset encoding / collation configurations. Try setting
  to 'latin1' or 'utf8' if you encounter problems.



== MediaWiki 1.5 release candidate 4 ==

August 29, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5rc4 is a preview release of the new 1.5 release series.
It fixes compatibility with PHP 5.1, and corrects two cross-site scripting
security bugs:

* <math> tags were handled incorrectly when TeX rendering support is off,
  as in the default configuration.
* Extension or <nowiki> sections in Wiki table syntax could bypass HTML
  style attribute restrictions for cross-site scripting attacks against
  Microsoft Internet Explorer

Wikis where the optional math support has been *enabled* are not vulnerable
to the first, but are vulnerable to the second.



== MediaWiki 1.5 release candidate 3 ==

August 24, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5rc3 is a preview release of the new 1.5 release series.
It fixes several major problems in 1.5rc2:

* Fixed a cross-site scripting injection in the search form
  (broken since 1.5beta1)

* Fixed upgrades from 1.4 database schema
  (broken since 1.5rc2)

1.3 and 1.4 releases are not vulnerable to the XSS bug, but anyone
running an earlier 1.5 beta or release candidate should upgrade
immediately.


== MediaWiki 1.5 release candidate 2 ==

August 23, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5rc2 is a preview release of the new 1.5 release series.
Numerous bug fixes since last beta, plus a security fix; see change
log below for full details.

A flaw in the interaction between extensions and HTML attribute
sanitization was discovered which could allow unauthorized use
of offsite resources in style sheets, and possible exploitation
of a JavaScript injection feature on Microsoft Internet Explorer.

This version expands the returned text and properly checks it
before output.

A 1.5rc1 release was mistakenly made from the incorrect source code
branch; 1.5rc2 is identical to the actual 1.5rc1 in revision control
except for version number.


== MediaWiki 1.5 beta 4 ==

July 30, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5 beta 4 is a preview release of the new 1.5 release series.
A number of bugs have been fixed since beta 3; see the full changelist below.


== MediaWiki 1.5 beta 3 ==

July 7, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5 beta 3 is a preview release of the new 1.5 release
series, with a security update over beta 2.

Incorrect escaping of a parameter in the page move template could
be used to inject JavaScript code by getting a victim to visit a
maliciously constructed URL. Users of vulnerable releases are
recommended to upgrade to this release.

Vulnerable versions:
* 1.5 preview series: n <= 1.5beta2 vulnerable, fixed in 1.5beta3
* 1.4 stable series: 1.4beta6 <= n <= 1.4.5 vulnerable, fixed in 1.4.6
* 1.3 legacy series: not vulnerable

This release also includes several bug fixes and localization updates.
See the changelog at the end of this file for a detailed list.



== MediaWiki 1.5 beta 2 ==

July 5, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5 beta 2 is a preview release of the new 1.5 release series.
While most exciting new bugs should have been ironed out at this point,
third-party wiki operators should probably not run this beta release
on a public site without closely following additional development.

Anyone who _has_ been running beta 1 is very very strongly advised to
upgrade to beta 2, as it fixes many bugs from the previous beta including
a couple of HTML and SQL injections.

This release should be followed by one or two release candidates and
a 1.5.0 final within the next few weeks.

Beta upgraders, note there are some minor database changes. For upgrades
from 1.4, see the file UPGRADE for details on significant database and
configuration file changes.

Beta 2 includes a preliminary command-line XML wiki dump importer tool,
maintenance/importDump.php, paired with maintenance/dumpBackup.php.
These use the same format as Special:Export and Special:Import, able
to package a wiki's entire page set independent of the backend database
and compression format.


== MediaWiki 1.5 beta 1 ==

June 26, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5 beta 1 is a preview release, pretty much feature complete,
of the new 1.5 release series. There are several known and likely a number
of unknown bugs; it is not recommended to use this release in a production
environment but would be recommended for testing in mind of an upcoming
deployment.

A number of significant changes have been made since the alpha releases,
including database changes and a reworking of the user permissions settings.
See the file UPGRADE for details of upgrading and changing your prior
configuration settings for the new system.



== MediaWiki 1.5 alpha 2 ==

June 3, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5 alpha 2 includes a lot of bug fixes, feature merges,
and a security update.

Incorrect handling of page template inclusions made it possible to
inject JavaScript code into HTML attributes, which could lead to
cross-site scripting attacks on a publicly editable wiki.

Vulnerable releases and fix:
* 1.5 prerelease: fixed in 1.5alpha2
* 1.4 stable series: fixed in 1.4.5
* 1.3 legacy series: fixed in 1.3.13
* 1.2 series no longer supported; upgrade to 1.4.5 strongly recommended


== MediaWiki 1.5 alpha 1 ==

May 3, 2005

This is a testing preview release, being put out mainly to aid testers in
finding installation bugs and other major problems. It is strongly recommended
NOT to run a live production web site on this alpha release.

**  WARNING: USE OF THIS ALPHA RELEASE MAY INFEST YOUR HOUSE WITH  **
**  TERMITES, ROT YOUR TEETH,  GROW HAIR ON YOUR PALMS, AND PASTE  **
**  INNUENDO  INTO  YOUR  C.V.  RIGHT  BEFORE  A  JOB  INTERVIEW!  **
**  DON'T SAY WE DIDN'T WARN YOU, MAN. WE TOTALLY DID RIGHT HERE.  **

Some output, particularly involving user-supplied inline HTML, may not
produce 100% valid or well-formed XHTML output. Testers are welcome to
set $wgMimeType = "application/xhtml+xml"; to test for remaining problem
cases, but this is not recommended on live sites. (This must be set for
MathML to display properly in Mozilla.)

== MediaWiki 1.4.3 ==

(released 2005-04-28)

MediaWiki 1.4.3 is a bugfix release for the 1.4 stable release series.

Chiefly, this fixes a compatibility problem with PHP 5 and a minor link
table corruption bug on initial page save.


== MediaWiki 1.4.2 ==

(released 2005-04-20)

MediaWiki 1.4.2 is a security and bug fix release for the 1.4 stable release
series.

A cross-site scripting injection vulnerability was discovered, which
affects only MSIE clients and is only open if MediaWiki has been
manually configured to run output through HTML Tidy ($wgUseTidy).

Several other bugs are fixed in this release, see the changelog below.

All new installations are highly recommended to use 1.4.2 instead of
1.3.x; 1.3.x users should consider upgrading for bug fixes and new
features. Ealier 1.4.x release and beta users should upgrade to this
release for relevant bug fixes; see the changelog later in this file.


If you have trouble, remember to read this whole file and the online FAQ page
before asking for help:

http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki_FAQ


=== READ THIS FIRST: Upgrading ===

If upgrading from an older release, see the notes in the file UPGRADE.
There are a couple of minor database changes from the beta releases,
and somewhat larger changes from 1.3.x.

Upgrading from a previous 1.4.x stable release installation should
generally only require copying the new files over the old ones.


==== READ THIS FIRST, TOO: MySQL 4.1 AND 5.0 ====

MySQL 5.0 is a beta release, not yet ready for production use. If you
are using it, the notes below about 4.1 apply to you too.

If you have the choice of MySQL 4.0 or MySQL 4.1 and don't need 4.1 for
some other application, you should consider sticking with 4.0 for the
moment. 4.1 may require you to do extra fiddling to get things to work
due to changes that aren't fully backwards-compatible.

MySQL 4.1 has changed the authentication protocol in an incompatible
way; many PHP installations still use the older client libraries and
CANNOT CONNECT TO THE SERVER WITH A PASSWORD without some changes.

See: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/Old_client.html

If MySQL is set with utf-8 as the default character set, installation
may fail with "key too long" errors. Set the default charset to 'latin1'
for installation and it should work.

The mysqldump backup generator now applies an automatic conversion to
UTF-8, which may irretrivably corrupt your data. Pass the -charset option
with the original default charset (eg 'latin1') to skip the conversion.


==== READ THIS FIRST IF RUNNING ON A WINDOWS SERVER ====

MediaWiki is tested and deployed primarily under the Apache web server
on Linux Unix systems. There are known to be problems running on
Microsoft's IIS which are not fully resolved. If you have a choice,
try running under Apache on Windows, or on a Unix/Linux box instead.

If you're having trouble with blank pages on IIS and can't switch,
try the workaround suggested in this bug report:
http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1763


=== New features ===

* 'Recentchanges Patrol' to mark new edits that haven't yet been viewed.
* New, searchable deletion/upload/protection logs
* Image gallery generation (Special:Newimages and <gallery> tag)
* SVG rasterization support (requires external support tools)
* Users can select from the available localizations to override the
  default user interface language.
* Traditional/Simplified Chinese conversion support
* rel="nofollow" support to combat linkspam

The current implementation adds this attribute to _all_ external URL
links in wiki text (but not internal [[wiki links]] or interwiki links).
To disable the attribute for _all_ external links, add this line to your
LocalSettings.php:

  $wgNoFollowLinks = false

For background information on nofollow see:

  http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html


=== Installation and compatibility ===

* The default MonoBook theme now works with PHP 5.0
* Installation on systems with PHP's safe mode or other oddities
  should work more reliably, as MonoBook no longer needs to
  create a compiled template file for the wiki to run.
* A table prefix may be specified, to avoid conflicts with other
  web applications forced to share a database.
* More thorough UTF-8 input validation; fixes non-ASCII uploaded
  filenames from Safari.
* Command-line database upgrade script.


=== Customizability ===

* Default user options can now be overridden in LocalSettings.
* Skins system more modular: templates and CSS are now in /skins/
  New skins can be dropped into this directory and used immediately.
* More extension hooks have been added.
* Authentication plugin hook.
* More internal code documentation, generated with phpdoc:
  http://www.mediawiki.org/docs/html/


=== Optimization ===

* For many operations, MediaWiki 1.4 should run faster and use
  less memory than MediaWiki 1.3. Page rendering is up to twice
  as fast. (Use a PHP accelerator such as Turck MMCache for best
  results with any PHP application, though!)
* The parser cache no longer requires memcached, and is enabled
  by default. This avoids a lot of re-rendering of pages that
  have been shown recently, greatly speeding longer page views.
* Support for compiled PHP modules to speed up page diff and
  Unicode validation/normalization. (Requires ability to compile
  and load PHP extensions).


=== What isn't ready yet ===

* A new user/groups permissions scheme has been held back to 1.5.
* An experimental SOAP interface will be made available as an extension
* PostgreSQL support is largely working, minus search and the installer.
  You can perform a manual installation.
* E-mail notification of watched page changes and verification of
  user-submitted e-mail addresses is not yet included.
* Log pages are not automatically imported into the new log table
  at upgrade time. A script to import old text log entries is
  incomplete, but may be available in later point releases.
* Some localizations are still incomplete.



== Changelog ==

=== Important security updates ===

A security audit found and fixed a number of problems. Users of MediaWiki
1.3.10 and earlier should upgrade to 1.3.11; users of 1.4 beta releases
prior to 1.4rc1 should upgrade immediately.

==== Cross-site scripting vulnerability ====

XSS injection points can be used to hijack session and authentication
cookies as well as more serious attacks.

* Media: links output raw text into an attribute value, potentially
  abusable for JavaScript injection. This has been corrected.
* Additional checks added to file upload to protect against MSIE and
  Safari MIME-type autodetection bugs.

As of 1.3.10/1.4beta6, per-user customized CSS and JavaScript is disabled
by default as a general precaution. Sites which want this ability may set
$wgAllowUserCss and $wgAllowUserJs in LocalSettings.php.


==== Cross-site request forgery ====

An attacker could use JavaScript-submitted forms to perform various
restricted actions by tricking an authenticated user into visiting
a malicious web page. A fix for page editing in 1.3.10/1.4beta6 has
been expanded in this release to other forms and functions.

Authors of bot tools may need to update their code to include the
additional fields.


==== Directory traversal ====

An unchecked parameter in image deletion could allow an authenticated
administrator to delete arbitary files in directories writable by the
web server, and confirm existence of files not deletable.


==== Older issues ====

Note that 1.4 beta releases prior to beta 5 include an input validation
error which could lead to execution of arbitrary PHP code on the server.
Users of older betas should upgrade immediately to the current version.


Beta 6 also introduces the use of rel="nofollow" attributes on external
links in wiki pages to reduce the effectiveness of wiki spam. This will
cause participating search engines to ignore external URL links from wiki
pages for purposes of page relevancy ranking.

=== Caveats ===

Some output, particularly involving user-supplied inline HTML, may not
produce 100% valid or well-formed XHTML output. Testers are welcome to
set $wgMimeType = "application/xhtml+xml"; to test for remaining problem
cases, but this is not recommended on live sites. (This must be set for
MathML to display properly in Mozilla.)
