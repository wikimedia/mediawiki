Security reminder: MediaWiki does not require PHP's register_globals
setting since version 1.2.0. If you have it on, turn it *off* if you can.

== MediaWiki 1.4.3 ==

(released 2005-04-28)

MediaWiki 1.4.3 is a bugfix release for the 1.4 stable release series.

Chiefly, this fixes a compatibility problem with PHP 5 and a minor link
table corruption bug on initial page save.


== MediaWiki 1.4.2 ==

(released 2005-04-20)

MediaWiki 1.4.2 is a security and bug fix release for the 1.4 stable release
series.

A cross-site scripting injection vulnerability was discovered, which
affects only MSIE clients and is only open if MediaWiki has been
manually configured to run output through HTML Tidy ($wgUseTidy).

Several other bugs are fixed in this release, see the changelog below.

All new installations are highly recommended to use 1.4.2 instead of
1.3.x; 1.3.x users should consider upgrading for bug fixes and new
features. Ealier 1.4.x release and beta users should upgrade to this
release for relevant bug fixes; see the changelog later in this file.


If you have trouble, remember to read this whole file and the online FAQ page
before asking for help:

http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki_FAQ


=== READ THIS FIRST: Upgrading ===

If upgrading from an older release, see the notes in the file UPGRADE.
There are a couple of minor database changes from the beta releases,
and somewhat larger changes from 1.3.x.

Upgrading from a previous 1.4.x stable release installation should
generally only require copying the new files over the old ones.


==== READ THIS FIRST, TOO: MySQL 4.1 AND 5.0 ====

MySQL 5.0 is a beta release, not yet ready for production use. If you
are using it, the notes below about 4.1 apply to you too.

If you have the choice of MySQL 4.0 or MySQL 4.1 and don't need 4.1 for
some other application, you should consider sticking with 4.0 for the
moment. 4.1 may require you to do extra fiddling to get things to work
due to changes that aren't fully backwards-compatible.

MySQL 4.1 has changed the authentication protocol in an incompatible
way; many PHP installations still use the older client libraries and
CANNOT CONNECT TO THE SERVER WITH A PASSWORD without some changes.

See: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/Old_client.html

If MySQL is set with utf-8 as the default character set, installation
may fail with "key too long" errors. Set the default charset to 'latin1'
for installation and it should work.

The mysqldump backup generator now applies an automatic conversion to
UTF-8, which may irretrivably corrupt your data. Pass the -charset option
with the original default charset (eg 'latin1') to skip the conversion.


==== READ THIS FIRST IF RUNNING ON A WINDOWS SERVER ====

MediaWiki is tested and deployed primarily under the Apache web server
on Linux Unix systems. There are known to be problems running on
Microsoft's IIS which are not fully resolved. If you have a choice,
try running under Apache on Windows, or on a Unix/Linux box instead.

If you're having trouble with blank pages on IIS and can't switch,
try the workaround suggested in this bug report:
http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1763


=== New features ===

* 'Recentchanges Patrol' to mark new edits that haven't yet been viewed.
* New, searchable deletion/upload/protection logs
* Image gallery generation (Special:Newimages and <gallery> tag)
* SVG rasterization support (requires external support tools)
* Users can select from the available localizations to override the
  default user interface language.
* Traditional/Simplified Chinese conversion support
* rel="nofollow" support to combat linkspam

The current implementation adds this attribute to _all_ external URL
links in wiki text (but not internal [[wiki links]] or interwiki links).
To disable the attribute for _all_ external links, add this line to your
LocalSettings.php:

  $wgNoFollowLinks = false

For background information on nofollow see:

  http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html


=== Installation and compatibility ===

* The default MonoBook theme now works with PHP 5.0
* Installation on systems with PHP's safe mode or other oddities
  should work more reliably, as MonoBook no longer needs to
  create a compiled template file for the wiki to run.
* A table prefix may be specified, to avoid conflicts with other
  web applications forced to share a database.
* More thorough UTF-8 input validation; fixes non-ASCII uploaded
  filenames from Safari.
* Command-line database upgrade script.


=== Customizability ===

* Default user options can now be overridden in LocalSettings.
* Skins system more modular: templates and CSS are now in /skins/
  New skins can be dropped into this directory and used immediately.
* More extension hooks have been added.
* Authentication plugin hook.
* More internal code documentation, generated with phpdoc:
  http://www.mediawiki.org/docs/html/


=== Optimization ===

* For many operations, MediaWiki 1.4 should run faster and use
  less memory than MediaWiki 1.3. Page rendering is up to twice
  as fast. (Use a PHP accelerator such as Turck MMCache for best
  results with any PHP application, though!)
* The parser cache no longer requires memcached, and is enabled
  by default. This avoids a lot of re-rendering of pages that
  have been shown recently, greatly speeding longer page views.
* Support for compiled PHP modules to speed up page diff and
  Unicode validation/normalization. (Requires ability to compile
  and load PHP extensions).


=== What isn't ready yet ===

* A new user/groups permissions scheme has been held back to 1.5.
* An experimental SOAP interface will be made available as an extension
* PostgreSQL support is largely working, minus search and the installer.
  You can perform a manual installation.
* E-mail notification of watched page changes and verification of
  user-submitted e-mail addresses is not yet included.
* Log pages are not automatically imported into the new log table
  at upgrade time. A script to import old text log entries is
  incomplete, but may be available in later point releases.
* Some localizations are still incomplete.



== Changelog ==

=== Important security updates ===

A security audit found and fixed a number of problems. Users of MediaWiki
1.3.10 and earlier should upgrade to 1.3.11; users of 1.4 beta releases
prior to 1.4rc1 should upgrade immediately.

==== Cross-site scripting vulnerability ====

XSS injection points can be used to hijack session and authentication
cookies as well as more serious attacks.

* Media: links output raw text into an attribute value, potentially
  abusable for JavaScript injection. This has been corrected.
* Additional checks added to file upload to protect against MSIE and
  Safari MIME-type autodetection bugs.

As of 1.3.10/1.4beta6, per-user customized CSS and JavaScript is disabled
by default as a general precaution. Sites which want this ability may set
$wgAllowUserCss and $wgAllowUserJs in LocalSettings.php.


==== Cross-site request forgery ====

An attacker could use JavaScript-submitted forms to perform various
restricted actions by tricking an authenticated user into visiting
a malicious web page. A fix for page editing in 1.3.10/1.4beta6 has
been expanded in this release to other forms and functions.

Authors of bot tools may need to update their code to include the
additional fields.


==== Directory traversal ====

An unchecked parameter in image deletion could allow an authenticated
administrator to delete arbitary files in directories writable by the
web server, and confirm existence of files not deletable.


==== Older issues ====

Note that 1.4 beta releases prior to beta 5 include an input validation
error which could lead to execution of arbitrary PHP code on the server.
Users of older betas should upgrade immediately to the current version.


Beta 6 also introduces the use of rel="nofollow" attributes on external
links in wiki pages to reduce the effectiveness of wiki spam. This will
cause participating search engines to ignore external URL links from wiki
pages for purposes of page relevancy ranking.

=== Caveats ===

Some output, particularly involving user-supplied inline HTML, may not
produce 100% valid or well-formed XHTML output. Testers are welcome to
set $wgMimeType = "application/xhtml+xml"; to test for remaining problem
cases, but this is not recommended on live sites. (This must be set for
MathML to display properly in Mozilla.)
