= MediaWiki 1.39 =

== MediaWiki 1.39.0-PRERELEASE ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.39 is an alpha-quality development branch, and is not recommended
for use in production.

== Upgrading notes for 1.39 ==
Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed per-version upgrade instructions from the
oldest supported upgrading version, MediaWiki 1.31.

Some specific notes for MediaWiki 1.39 upgrades are below:
* (T278139) Drop PHP 7.3 support in MediaWiki 1.39; require 7.4.3 or higher.
* …

For notes on 1.38.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

=== Configuration changes for system administrators in 1.39 ===
* The default serialization method for file meta-data has been changed to JSON.
  You can revert it to PHP by setting the 'useJsonMetadata' property to false in
  $wgLocalFileRepo.
* The DBO_SSL flag in $wgDBservers and $wgLBFactoryConf has been deprecated in
  favour of a boolean "ssl" parameter.
* $wgMangleFlashPolicy is deprecated and is no longer functional. Users who are
  somehow still using Flash as a browser extension will be exposed to CSRF
  vulnerabilities.
* …

==== New configuration ====
* $wgAutoCreateTempUser – configures automatic user creation on page save.
* $wgCopyUploadAllowOnWikiDomainConfig – Configures if administrators can use
  the MediaWiki:Copyupload-allowed-domains system message to define which
  domains can be used with the upload-by-url tool.
* $wgLBFactoryConf['configCallback'] can be set to a callback function that
  returns an array with keys to update in $wgLBFactoryConf. This can be used
  to update the database configuration on the fly, e.g. to take replica hosts
  out of rotation.
* $wgCdnMatchParameterOrder can be set to false if MediaWiki is behind a CDN
  that re-orders query parameters. This will make the code that matches request
  URLs to canonical CDN URLs insensitive to parameter order.
* $wgMultiShardSiteStats – split site_stats across multiple rows.
  Only useful for very large, heavily edited wikis. (T306589)
* …

==== Changed configuration ====
* $wgInvalidUsernameCharacters now contains the char '>',
  reserved delimiter for external user names.
* …

==== Removed configuration ====
* $wgMultiContentRevisionSchemaMigrationStage - Migration is over, was
  deprecated since 1.35.
* $wgWikiFarmSiteDetector – experimental setting removed without replacement.
  Use the MW_WIKI_NAME environment variable to specifiy the name of the site
  to load configuration for. Using the WIKI_NAME environment variable for this
  purpose is deprecated.
* $wgParserCacheUseJson - the ParserCache now always uses JSON serialization.
  Reading old non-JSON cache entries is still supported. The setting had been
  deprecated since 1.36.
* $wgAllowJavaUploads - To allow uploads of JAR files, remove application/java
  from $wgMimeTypeExclusions.
* $wgMaxRedirects has been removed. This feature never worked as intended,
  see T296430.
* $wgElementTiming has been removed. This feature was experimental,
  and disabled by default.
* $wgPriorityHints and $wgPriorityHintsRatio have been removed.
  This feature was experimental, and disabled by default.
* $wgActorTableSchemaMigrationStage has been removed. Migration is over.
* In $wgObjectCaches, globalKeyLB and localKeyLB are no longer supported.
* $wgLegacySchemaConversion - This global configuration has been
  removed because it was unused.
* $wgInterwikiPrefixDisplayTypes - This global configuration has been
  removed because it was unused.
* …

=== New user-facing features in 1.39 ===
* Optional automatic user creation on page save ($wgAutoCreateTempUser)
* Administrators now have the option to delete/undelete the associated "Talk"
  page when they are (un)deleting a given page. `deletetalk` and `undeletetalk`
  options were added to the 'delete' and 'undelete' action APIs in MW 1.38.
* `{{=}}` is now a wikitext built-in magic word, expanding to `=`.  This is
  conventionally used as an escape mechanism to allow the use of `=` in
  unnamed template arguments.  Defining [[Template:=]] to expand to something
  other than `=` has been deprecated since 1.36, with affected pages put into
  a special tracking category for migration.
* (T284020) Bot passwords are now supported when using the REST API.
* …

=== New developer features in 1.39 ===
* JsonValidateSaveHook has been added to allow extensions to set additional
  pre-save validations for specific JSON pages (T313254)
* Added 'PermissionErrorAudit' hook, enabling extensions to audit permission
  errors on specfic actions. For instance account registration failed attempts
  due to a block (T306018).
* …

* (T314013) $wgExtraNamespaces no longer overrides canonical namespace names

  namespaceDupes.php after upgrading.

  all revisions of the associated talk page.

=== Languages updated in 1.39 ===
MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated regularly.
Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as changes to languages
because of Phabricator reports.

* Actual localization was added for several languages, which were already
  in Names.php and even used for a Wikipedia:
** (T313200) Added language support for Rundi (Kirundi, rn).
** (T310976) Added language support for Tumbuka (ChiTumbuka, tum).
** (T314270) Added language support for Kanuri (kr).
* (T313199) Added language support for Sylheti (syl).
* (T311975) Added language support for Ghanaian Pidgin (gpe).
* (T307080) Added language support for Okinawan (ryu).

* (T304920) In Swahili, The "Media" namespace is now "Media", as in English,
  and the "File" namespace is now "Faili". The old name of the "File" namespace
  was "Picha", and it's kept for backwards compatibility. If you manage a wiki
  in Swahili, and you use "Faili:" as a namespace anywhere in wikitext, and
  you mean to use it as "Media:", these need to be replaced to "Media:".
* (T309866) Some namespace translations were updated for Kyrgyz (ky). The old
  ones are retained as aliases for backwards compatibility.

* Instantiating HTMLCacheUpdate class, deprecated in 1.34, now emits deprecation
  warnings.
* ISQLPlatform::tableNames() (implemented by IDatabase) is soft deprecated.
  None of the tableName*() functions should be used by most users;
  if you absolutely must use raw SQL, write several tableName() calls instead.
* …

=== Other changes in 1.39 ===
* Dynamic default values are now applied before extension registration callbacks
  are run. This way, extensions have a complete view of config variables, with
  all defaults applied. For example, when the default value of X used to be
  static but becomes dynamic, and an extension reads the value of X in the
  registration callback, it will now continue to function as expected. In some
  cases however, this may cause an undesired change in behavior: if the dynamic
  default of setting X depends on the value of setting Y, and an extension
  changes Y, the changed value of Y will no longer affect the value of X.
