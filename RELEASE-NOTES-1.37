=== Breaking changes in 1.37 ===
* The Revision class, hard deprecated in 1.35, was removed entirely. As
  part of this, the following hooks that included a Revision object
  were removed:

  - ArticleRollbackComplete - use RollbackComplete
  - DiffRevisionTools - use DiffTools
  - DiffViewHeader - use DifferenceEngineViewHeader
  - HistoryRevisionTools - use HistoryTools

  - UserRetrieveNewTalks - no replacement
  and the following methods and variables have been removed
  - Article::$mRevision

  The following methods return arrays that formerly included a 'revision'
  key that would emit deprecation warnings when accessed and return a
  Revision object. The Revision object has been removed from the arrays,
  and the 'revision-record' key should be used to get the relevant
  RevisionRecord instead:
  - PageUpdater::doCreate()
  - PageUpdater::doModify()
  - Parser::statelessFetchTemplate()
  - WikiPage::doEditContent()
  The ParserOptions `templateCallback` option is a callback that is called
  in Parser::fetchTemplateAndTitle() and should return an array - the
  'revision' key to that array used to be a Revision object and was used if
  no 'revision-record' was returned - it is now ignored.
* Previously, the classes RevisionTestModifyableContent and
  RevisionTestModifyableContentHandler were loaded for use in tests, but
  were only used within the tests for the since-removed Revision class. This
  content and content handler class were removed without deprecation.
* WANObjectCache::HOLDOFF_NONE, deprecated since 1.35, was removed.
  Use HOLDOFF_TTL_NONE instead.

   - findVariantLink()
   - mConverter
   - updateConversionTable()
* The following methods in the Parser class have been removed after having
  been deprecated in 1.35:
   - fetchTemplate()

  in 1.35, were removed.

  since 1.36, has been removed. Use "mediawiki.action.protect" instead.
* AuthenticationProvider interface doesn't extend LoggerAwareInterface.
  So AuthenticationProvider can't be typehinted as LoggerAwareInterface.
* User::getGrantName(), hard deprecated since 1.36, has been removed.
  Use MWGrants::grantName instead.

  instead of using it, get a UserIdentity by name from UserIdentityLookup.

  Previously, a warning was issued if there were multiple unique keys provided.

  MediaWiki:Block-autoblock-exemptionlist. The backward-compatibility of reading
  the old MediaWiki:Autoblock_whitelist page has now been dropped.

  - use-filebackend => PHPUNIT_USE_FILEBACKEND
  - use-bagostuff => PHPUNIT_USE_BAGOSTUFF
  - use-jobqueue => PHPUNIT_USE_JOBQUEUE
  This is so that we can use the default PHPUnit entry point (T90875).
* The PHPUNIT_REUSE_DB / --reuse-db option was removed from the phpunit.php
  runner. It had been broken for at least three years already. The original use
  case was speeding up tests on Oracle, but Oracle support was dropped several

* ActorMigrationBase::getExistingActorId and ::getNewActorId, hard deprecated

  was deprecated since 1.35.

  entirely.
* The SkinTemplateTabAction hook, deprecated in 1.35, was removed entirely.
* The SkinTemplateBuildNavUrlsNav_urlsAfterPermalink hook, deprecated in 1.35,

  supported. Use MergeHistoryFactory instead. MergeHistory::checkPermissions,
  deprecated since 1.36, was removed.
* Skin::generateDebugHTML(), deprecated since 1.35, was removed. Call
  MWDebug::getHTMLDebugLog() directly.
* The ApiTestCase class no longer interacts with the global $wgUser.
  Previously, the global variable was set at the start of each test, and in
  ApiTestCase::doApiRequest() if a performer was specified $wgUser was
  updated to match, and if no performer was specified $wgUser was used
  instead. Now, $wgUser is not updated, and if no performer is specified
  the reusable TestUser object for the sysop is relied on. Extensions
  or skins that rely on the global $wgUser variable (which has been
  deprecated since 1.35) should instead retrieve the acting user from the
  relevant context source.
* SkinTemplate::makeArticleUrlDetails, deprecated since 1.35, was removed.

  was removed.
