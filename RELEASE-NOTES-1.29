== MediaWiki 1.29 ==

=== Configuration changes in 1.29 ===
* Default cookie expiration time has been reduced to 30 days. Login cookie
  expiration time is kept at 180 days.
* A new configuration variable has been added: $wgCookieSetOnAutoblock. This
  determines whether to set a cookie when a user is autoblocked. Doing so means
  that a blocked user, even after logging out and moving to a new IP address,
  will still be blocked.
* The resetpassword right and associated password reset capture feature has
  been removed.
* The $error parameter to the EmailUser hook should be set to a Status object
  or boolean false. This should be compatible with at least MediaWiki 1.23 if
  not earlier. Returning a raw HTML string is now deprecated.
* The $message parameter to the ApiCheckCanExecute hook should be set to an
  ApiMessage. This is compatible with MediaWiki 1.27 and later. Returning a
  code for ApiBase::parseMsg() will no longer work.
* ApiBase::$messageMap is no longer public. Code attempting to access it will
  result in a PHP fatal error.
* $wgUserEmailUseReplyTo is now true by default to work around restrictive DMARC
  policies.
* Subpages are now enabled by default in the Template namespace. Set
  $wgNamespacesWithSubpages[NS_TEMPLATE] to false to keep the old behavior.
* $wgRunJobsAsync is now false by default (T142751). This change only affects
  wikis with $wgJobRunRate > 0.
* (T158474) "Unknown user" has been added to $wgReservedUsernames.
* (T156983) $wgRateLimitsExcludedIPs now accepts CIDR ranges as well as single IPs.
* $wgDummyLanguageCodes is deprecated. Additional language code mappings may be
  added to $wgExtraLanguageCodes instead.
* (T161453) LocalisationCache will no longer use the temporary directory in it's
  fallback chain when trying to work out where to write the cache.
* The user right 'editusercssjs' (deprecated in 1.16) was removed. Use
  'editusercss' and 'edituserjs' in $wgGroupPermissions and elsewhere instead.

=== New features in 1.29 ===
* (T5233) A cookie can now be set when a user is autoblocked, to track that user
  if they move to a new IP address. This is disabled by default.
* Added ILocalizedException interface to standardize the use of localized
  exceptions, largely so the API can handle them more sensibly.
* Blocks created automatically by MediaWiki, such as for configured proxies or
  dnsbls, are now indicated as such and use a new i18n message when displayed.
* Added new $wgHTTPImportTimeout setting. Sets timeout for
  downloading the XML dump during a transwiki import in seconds.
* Parser limit report is now available in machine-readable format to JavaScript
  via mw.config.get('wgPageParseReport').
* Added $wgSoftBlockRanges, to allow for automatically blocking anonymous edits
  from certain IP ranges (e.g. private IPs).
* (T59603) Added new magic word {{PAGELANGUAGE}} which returns the language code
  of the page being parsed.
* HTML5 form validation attributes will no longer be suppressed. Originally
  browsers had poor support for them, but modern browsers handle them fine.
  This might affect some forms that used them and only worked because the
  attributes were not actually being set.
* Expiry times can now be specified when users are added to user groups.
* Completely new user interface for the RecentChanges page, which
  structures filters into user-friendly groups.  This has corresponding
  changes to how filters are registered by core and extensions.
* The edit form now uses pretty OOjs UI buttons, checkboxes and summary input.
  Because this change can cause problems for extensions and on-wiki
  scripts depending on the exact HTML, the old version is still available
  and can be used by setting $wgOOUIEditPage = false; in LocalSettings.php.
  This will be removed later and OOjs UI will become the only option.
  To make testing easier, users can also force either mode by adding
  &ooui=true or &ooui=false to the action=edit URL.

  syntax's link parameter.
* (T108138) SECURITY: Sysops can undelete pages, although the page is protected against
  it.

=== Action API changes in 1.29 ===
* Submitting sensitive authentication request parameters to action=login,
  action=clientlogin, action=createaccount, action=linkaccount, and
  action=changeauthenticationdata in the query string is now an error. They
  should be submitted in the POST body instead.
* The capture option for action=resetpassword has been removed
* action=clearhasmsg now requires a POST.
* (T47843) API errors and warnings may be requested in non-English languages
  using the new 'errorformat', 'errorlang', and 'errorsuselocal' parameters.
* API error codes may have changed. Most notably, errors from modules using
  parameter prefixes (e.g. all query submodules) will no longer be prefixed.
* ApiPageSet-using modules will report the 'invalidreason' using the specified
  'errorformat'.
* action=emailuser may return a "Warnings" status, and now returns 'warnings' and
  'errors' subelements (as applicable) instead of 'message'.
* action=imagerotate returns an 'errors' subelement rather than 'errormessage'.
* action=move now reports errors when moving the talk page as an array under
  key 'talkmove-errors', rather than using 'talkmove-error-code' and
  'talkmove-error-info'. The format for subpage move errors has also changed.
* action=revisiondelete no longer includes a "rendered" property on warnings
  and errors for each item. Use errorformat=wikitext if you're wanting parsed
  output.
* action=rollback no longer returns a "messageHtml" property. Use
  errorformat=html if you're wanting HTML formatting of error messages.
* action=upload now reports optional stash failures as an array under key
  'stasherrors' rather than a 'stashfailed' text string.
* action=watch reports 'errors' and 'warnings' instead of a single 'error', and
  no longer returns a 'message' on success.
* Added action=validatepassword to validate passwords for the account creation
  and password change forms.
* action=purge now requires a POST.
* There is a new `languagevariants` siprop for action=query&meta=siteinfo,
  which returns a list of languages with active LanguageConverter instances.
* action=query&query=allpages will no longer filter redirects using a database
  query in miser mode. This may result in less results being returned than were
  requested.

=== Action API internal changes in 1.29 ===
* New methods were added to ApiBase to handle errors and warnings using i18n
  keys. Methods for using hard-coded English messages were deprecated:
  * ApiBase::dieUsage() was deprecated
  * ApiBase::dieUsageMsg() was deprecated
  * ApiBase::dieUsageMsgOrDebug() was deprecated
  * ApiBase::getErrorFromStatus() was deprecated
  * ApiBase::parseMsg() was deprecated
  * ApiBase::setWarning() was deprecated
* ApiBase::$messageMap is no longer public. Code attempting to access it will
  result in a PHP fatal error.
* The $message parameter to the ApiCheckCanExecute hook should be set to an
  ApiMessage. This is compatible with MediaWiki 1.27 and later. Returning a
  code for ApiBase::parseMsg() will no longer work.
* UsageException is deprecated in favor of ApiUsageException. For the time
  being ApiUsageException is a subclass of UsageException to allow things that
  catch only UsageException to still function properly.
* If, for some strange reason, code was using an ApiErrorFormatter instead of
  ApiErrorFormatter_BackCompat, note that the result format has changed and
  various methods now take a module path rather than a module name.
* ApiMessageTrait::getApiCode() now strips 'apierror-' and 'apiwarn-' prefixes
  from the message key, and maps some message keys for backwards compatibility.
* API parameters may now be marked as "sensitive" to keep their values out of
  the logs.

=== extension.json changes in 1.29 ===
* Extensions must set a value for "manifest_version" in their extension.json
  or skin.json files. See
  <https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Extension.json/Schema#manifest_version>
  for details.
* Extensions can now specify dependencies upon other extensions by using the
  "requires" key. See
  <https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Extension.json/Schema#requires> for
  more details.
* (T151136) Functions set as the "callback" now recieve that extension's credits
  information as the first argument.
* (T149597) "PasswordPolicy" can be set in extension.json.

=== Languages updated in 1.29 ===

MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated
regularly. Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as
changes to languages because of Phabricator reports.

* Based as always on linguistic studies on intelligibility and language
  knowledge by geography, language fallbacks have been expanded. When a
  translation is missing in the user's preferred interface language, the
  corresponding translation for the fallback language will be used instead.
  English will only be used as last resort when there are no translations.
  Some configurations (such as date formats and gender namespaces) have also
  been updated when using the fallback language's configuration was inadequate.
  The new or reinstated language fallbacks are (after cs ↔ sk in 1.28):
  ca ↔ oc; hsb ↔ dsb; io → eo; mdf → ru; pnt → el; roa-tara → it; rup → ro;
  sh → bs, sr-el, hr.
* (T137376) New language support: Atikamekw (atj).
* (T163600) New language support: Dinka (din).
* (T155957) Talk Namespaces for Javanese language (jv) have been updated.

==== No fallback for Ukrainian ====
* (T39314) The fallback from Ukrainian to Russian was removed. The Ukrainian
  language will now use the default fallback language: English. When a translation
  to Ukrainian is not available, an English string will be shown.

* Database::getSearchEngine() (deprecated in 1.28) was removed. Use
  SearchEngineFactory::getSearchEngineClass() instead.

* wiki.phtml entry point was removed.  Refer to index.php instead. If you want "wiki.phtml"
  URLs to continue to work, set up redirects. In Apache, this can be done by enabling
  mod_rewrite and adding the following rules to your configuration:

    RewriteEngine On

  or a tracking category with --tracking-category=...
* User-like objects that are passed to SpecialUserRights and its subclasses are
  now required to have a getGroupMemberships() method. See UserRightsProxy for
  an example.
* User::$mGroups (instance variable) was marked private. Use User::getGroups()
  instead.
* User::getGroupName(), User::getGroupMember(), User:getGroupPage(),
  User::makeGroupLinkHTML(), and User::makeGroupLinkWiki() were deprecated.
  Use equivalent methods on the UserGroupMembership class.

* BREAKING CHANGE: Internal signature changes to ChangesListSpecialPage
  and subclasses.  It should only break if you call buildMainQueryConds
  (changed to buildQuery with new signature) or doMainQuery (new
  signature).  Subclasses are likely to call at least doMainQuery
  (possibly both), but other classes might too, because they were
  public.
  Also, some related hooks were deprecated, but this is not yet a
  breaking change.
* Removed 'jquery.arrowSteps' module. (deprecated since 1.28)
* The 'jquery.autoEllipsis' ResourceLoader module is now deprecated.
* WikiRevision::$fileIsTemp was deprecated.
* WikiRevision::$importer was deprecated.
* WikiRevision::$user was deprecated.
* Article::getLastPurgeTimestamp(), WikiPage::getLastPurgeTimestamp(), and the
  WikiPage::PURGE_* constants are deprecated, and the functions will always
  return false. They were a hack for an issue that has since been fixed.
* Hook 'EditPageBeforeEditChecks' is now deprecated. Instead use the new hook
  'EditPageGetCheckboxesDefinition', or 'EditPage::showStandardInputs:options'
  if you don't actually care about checkboxes and just want to add some HTML
  to the page.
* Selflinks are now rendered as href-less <a> tags with the class mw-selflink
  rather than <strong> tags. The old class name, "selflink", was deprecated
  and will be removed in a future release. (T160480)
* (T156184) $wgRawHtml will no longer apply to internationalization messages.
* Browser support for non-ES5 JavaScript browsers, including Android 2,
  Opera <12.10, and Internet Explorer 9, was lowered from Grade A to Grade C.
* Removed wikibits global methods deprecated since MediaWiki 1.17 (T122755):
  is_gecko, is_chrome_mac, is_chrome, webkit_version, is_safari_win, is_safari,
  webkit_match, is_ff2, ff2_bugs, is_ff2_win, is_ff2_x11, opera95_bugs,
  opera7_bugs, opera6_bugs, is_opera_95, is_opera_preseven, is_opera,
  ie6_bugs, clientPC, changeText, killEvt, addHandler, hookEvent,
  addClickHandler, removeHandler, getElementsByClassName, getInnerText,
  setupCheckboxShiftClick, addCheckboxClickHandlers, mwEditButtons,
  mwCustomEditButtons, injectSpinner, removeSpinner, escapeQuotes,
  escapeQuotesHTML, jsMsg, addPortletLink, appendCSS, tooltipAccessKeyPrefix,
  tooltipAccessKeyRegexp, updateTooltipAccessKeys.
* The ID of the <li> element containing the login link has changed from
  'pt-login' to 'pt-login-private' in private wikis.
* The old, neglected "bulletin board style toolbar" in the edit form is now
  deprecated (T30856). This old code dates from 2006, and was replaced in the
  MediaWiki release tarball and in Wikimedia production by the WikiEditor
  extension in 2010. It is only shown to users if no other editor was
  installed, and leads to confusion.
* (T92459) Loading ResourceLoader modules containing JavaScript through
  addModuleStyles() is deprecated and will log a warning server-side.

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.29 requires PHP 5.5.9 or later. There is experimental support for
HHVM 3.6.5 or later.

MySQL/MariaDB is the recommended DBMS. PostgreSQL or SQLite can also be used,
but support for them is somewhat less mature. There is experimental support for
Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server.

The supported versions are:

* MySQL 5.0.3 or later
* PostgreSQL 8.3 or later
* SQLite 3.3.7 or later
* Oracle 9.0.1 or later
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 (9.00.1399)

== Upgrading ==

1.29 has several database changes since 1.28, and will not work without schema
updates. Note that due to changes to some very large tables like the revision
table, the schema update may take quite long (minutes on a medium sized site,
many hours on a large site).

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions, including
important information when upgrading from versions prior to 1.11.

For notes on 1.28.x and older releases, see HISTORY.
