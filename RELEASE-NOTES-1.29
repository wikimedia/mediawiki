== MediaWiki 1.29 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.29 is an alpha-quality branch and is not recommended for use in
production.

=== Configuration changes in 1.29 ===
* Default cookie expiration time has been reduced to 30 days. Login cookie expiration time is
  kept at 180 days.
* A new configuration variable has been added: $wgCookieSetOnAutoblock. This
  determines whether to set a cookie when a user is autoblocked. Doing so means
  that a blocked user, even after logging out and moving to a new IP address,
  will still be blocked.
* The resetpassword right and associated password reset capture feature has
  been removed.

=== New features in 1.29 ===
* (T5233) A cookie can now be set when a user is autoblocked, to track that user if
  they move to a new IP address. This is disabled by default.

=== External library changes in 1.29 ===

==== Upgraded external libraries ====
* Updated QUnit from v1.22.0 to v1.23.1.

==== New external libraries ====

==== Removed and replaced external libraries ====

=== Bug fixes in 1.29 ===

=== Action API changes in 1.29 ===
* Submitting sensitive authentication request parameters to action=clientlogin,
  action=createaccount, action=linkaccount, and action=changeauthenticationdata
  in the query string is now an error. They should be submitted in the POST
  body instead.
* The capture option for action=resetpassword has been removed
* action=clearhasmsg now requires a POST.

=== Action API internal changes in 1.29 ===

=== Languages updated in 1.29 ===

MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated
regularly. Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as
changes to languages because of Phabricator reports.

==== No fallback for Ukrainian ====
* (T39314) The fallback from Ukrainian to Russian was removed. The Ukrainian
  language will now use the default fallback language: English. When a translation
  to Ukrainian is not available, an English string will be shown.

=== Other changes in 1.29 ===
* Database::getSearchEngine() (deprecated in 1.28) was removed. Use
  SearchEngineFactory::getSearchEngineClass() instead.
* $wgSessionsInMemcached (deprecated in 1.20) was removed. No replacement is
  required as all sessions are stored in Object Cache now.
* MWHttpRequest::execute() should be considered to return a StatusValue; the
  Status return type is deprecated.
* WikiRevision::getText(), Article::getText() and Article::prepareTextForEdit()
  (deprecated in 1.21) were removed.
* Article::getAutosummary() and WikiPage::getAutosummary (deprecated in 1.21)
  were removed.

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.29 requires PHP 5.5.9 or later. There is experimental support for
HHVM 3.6.5 or later.

MySQL is the recommended DBMS. PostgreSQL or SQLite can also be used, but
support for them is somewhat less mature. There is experimental support for
Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server.

The supported versions are:

* MySQL 5.0.3 or later
* PostgreSQL 8.3 or later
* SQLite 3.3.7 or later
* Oracle 9.0.1 or later
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 (9.00.1399)

== Upgrading ==

1.29 has several database changes since 1.28, and will not work without schema
updates. Note that due to changes to some very large tables like the revision
table, the schema update may take quite long (minutes on a medium sized site,
many hours on a large site).

If upgrading from before 1.11, and you are using a wiki as a commons
repository, make sure that it is updated as well. Otherwise, errors may arise
due to database schema changes.

If upgrading from before 1.7, you may want to run refreshLinks.php to ensure
new database fields are filled with data.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, you should upgrade to
1.5 first. The upgrade script maintenance/upgrade1_5.php has been removed
with MediaWiki 1.21.

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.
