=== Deprecations in 1.45 ===

* UserNameUtils::getTempPlaceholder() has been deprecated and now emits

  when a site is set to read-only mode.

  the 'address' parameter to DatabaseBlock::__construct() is now deprecated
  and will emit deprecation warnings. Use BlockTargetFactory to obtain a

  $preferencesFactory has been deprecated and emits deprecation warnings.

=== Other changes in 1.45 ===

* Reading parser cache content using native PHP serialization has been
  removed in this release.  JSON serialization was been the default
  since 1.36, and the option to use native serialization was removed
  in 1.39.  Upgrades from revision 1.38 and earlier with
  $wgParserCacheUseJson=false should either clear the parser cache, or
  upgrade to revision 1.36-1.44 with $wgParserCacheUseJson=true and
  wait until the parser cache expiration time
  ($wgParserCacheExpireTime) elapses before upgrading to this release.
