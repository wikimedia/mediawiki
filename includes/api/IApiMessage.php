/**
 * Interface for messages with machine-readable data for use by the API
 *
 * The idea is that it's a Message that has some extra data for the API to use when interpreting it
 * as an error (or, in the future, as a warning). Internals of MediaWiki often use messages (or
 * message keys, or Status objects containing messages) to pass information about errors to the user
 * (see e.g. Title::getUserPermissionsErrors()) and the API has to make do with that.
 *
 * @since 1.25
 * @note This interface exists to work around PHP's inheritance, so ApiMessage
 *  can extend Message and ApiRawMessage can extend RawMessage while still
 *  allowing an instanceof check for a Message object including this
 *  functionality. If for some reason you feel the need to implement this
 *  interface on some other class, that class must also implement all the
 *  public methods the Message class provides (not just those from
 *  MessageSpecifier, which as written is fairly useless).
 * @ingroup API
