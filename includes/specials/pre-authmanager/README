This directory temporarily hosts pre-AuthManager code as a way of feature-flagging.
Class names are postfixed with 'PreAuthManager' and SpecialPageFactory adds/removes
that postfix based on the feature flag.

This is a horrible hack that will only be in place for a few weeks, to allow instant
rollback while AuthManager is tested in WMF production and major problems are ironed
out. In the past such issues have been handled via deployment branches, but that
meant blocking the work of all WMF developers from being deployed. This is hoped
to be a less disruptive method.
