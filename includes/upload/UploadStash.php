/**
 * UploadStash is intended to accomplish a few things:
 *   - enable applications to temporarily stash files without publishing them to the wiki.
 *      - Several parts of MediaWiki do this in similar ways: UploadBase, UploadWizard, and FirefoggChunkedExtension
 *        And there are several that reimplement stashing from scratch, in idiosyncratic ways. The idea is to unify them all here.
 *	  Mostly all of them are the same except for storing some custom fields, which we subsume into the data array.
 *   - enable applications to find said files later, as long as the db table or temp files haven't been purged.
 *   - enable the uploading user (and *ONLY* the uploading user) to access said files, and thumbnails of said files, via a URL.
 *     We accomplish this using a database table, with ownership checking as you might expect. See SpecialUploadStash, which
 *     implements a web interface to some files stored this way.
 *
 * UploadStash right now is *mostly* intended to show you one user's slice of the entire stash. The user parameter is only optional
 * because there are few cases where we clean out the stash from an automated script. In the future we might refactor this.
 *
 * UploadStash represents the entire stash of temporary files.
 * UploadStashFile is a filestore for the actual physical disk files.
 * UploadFromStash extends UploadBase, and represents a single stashed file as it is moved from the stash to the regular file repository
