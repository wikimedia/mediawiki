/**
 * Wrapper for another HandlerInterface that will only handle a percentage of
 * records offered to it.
 *
 * When HandlerInterface::handle() is called for a given record, it will be
 * handled or ignored with a one in N chance based on the sample factor given
 * for the handler.
 *
 * Usage with MWLoggerMonologSpi:
 * @code
 * $wgMWLoggerDefaultSpi = array(
 *   'class' => 'MWLoggerMonologSpi',
 *   'args' => array( array(
 *     'handlers' => array(
 *       'some-handler' => array( ... ),
 *       'sampled-some-handler' => array(
 *         'class' => 'MWLoggerMonologSamplingHandler',
 *         'args' => array(
 *           function() {
 *             return MWLogger::getProvider()->getHandler( 'some-handler');
 *           },
 *           2, // emit logs with a 1:2 chance
 *         ),
 *       ),
 *     ),
 *   ) ),
 * );
 * @endcode
 *
 * A sampled event stream can be useful for logging high frequency events in
 * a production environment where you only need an idea of what is happening
 * and are not concerned with capturing every occurence. Since the decision to
 * handle or not handle a particular event is determined randomly, the
 * resulting sampled log is not guaranteed to contain 1/N of the events that
 * occurred in the application but based on [[Law of large numbers]] it will
 * tend to be close to this ratio with a large number of attempts.
