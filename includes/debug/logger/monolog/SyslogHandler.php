/**
 * Log handler that supports sending log events to a syslog server using RFC
 * 3164 formatted UDP packets.
 *
 * Monolog's SyslogUdpHandler creates a partial RFC 5424 header (PRI and
 * VERSION) and relies on the associated formatter to complete the header and
 * message payload. This makes using it with a fixed format formatter like
 * \Monolog\Formatter\LogstashFormatter impossible. Additionally, the
 * direct syslog input for Logstash only handles RFC 3164 syslog packets.
 *
 * This Handler should work with any Formatter. The formatted message will be
 * prepended with an RFC 3164 message header and a partial message body. The
 * resulting packet will looks something like:
 *
 *   <PRI>DATETIME HOSTNAME PROGRAM: MESSAGE
 *
 * This format works as input to rsyslog and can also be processed by the
 * default Logstash syslog input handler.
