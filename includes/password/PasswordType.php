/**
 * Low-Level PasswordType abstract class
 *
 * This class implements the lowest level interface a password type implementation
 * may use to implement a password type. This level gives you direct access
 * to the raw data with no parameter parsing and direct control over the verify
 * method. If you are writing a normal hash or derived key comparison based
 * password type implementation you should use BasePasswordType instead.
 *
 * To implement a raw password type implementation you subclass PasswordType
 * and implement the following methods:
 *  public function crypt( $password );
 *    From this method you must take the password given to you by the user and return
 *    the raw data that will be stored inside the database.
 *
 *  public function verify( $data, $password );
 *    From this method you must accept data in the format you output from crypt() and
 *    verify a password against it. You must return true or false to indicate whether
 *    the password is correct or incorrect.
 *    If there is something wrong with the data you should `throw self::error( ... );`
 *    to indicate that the data is bad rather than the password being invalid.
 *
 *  public function needsUpdate( $data );
 *    This method is optional. If your password implementation has parameters which use
 *    site configuration for you can use this method to return true when the params do not
 *    match the ones used in site configuration. This will trigger an update that will
 *    regenerate the password data for the password.
 *
 *  public function knownPasswordData();
 *    This method should be written after you have finished your password implementation.
 *    You should generate some password data using your implementation and list that data
 *    along with the associated password in the output from this method. This will then
 *    ensure that your password implementation has tests to ensure it is not broken.
