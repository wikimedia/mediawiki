/**
 * File repository structures
 *
 * $wgLocalFileRepo is a single repository structure, and $wgForeignFileRepos is

 * array of properties configuring the repository.
 *
 * Properties required for all repos:
 *   - class            The class name for the repository. May come from the core or an extension.
 *                      The core repository classes are FileRepo, LocalRepo, ForeignDBRepo.
 *
 *   - name             A unique name for the repository (but $wgLocalFileRepo should be 'local').
 *                      The name should consist of alpha-numeric characters.
 *   - backend          A file backend name (see $wgFileBackends).
 *
 * For most core repos:
 *   - zones            Associative array of zone names that each map to an array with:
 *                          container  : backend container name the zone is in
 *                          directory  : root path within container for the zone
 *                          url        : base URL to the root of the zone
 *                          urlsByExt  : map of file extension types to base URLs
 *                                       (useful for using a different cache for videos)
 *                      Zones default to using "<repo name>-<zone name>" as the container name
 *                      and default to using the container root as the zone's root directory.
 *                      Nesting of zone locations within other zones should be avoided.
 *   - url              Public zone URL. The 'zones' settings take precedence.
 *   - hashLevels       The number of directory levels for hash-based division of files.
 *
 *                      Set this to 0 if you do not want MediaWiki to divide your images
 *                      directory into many subdirectories.
 *
 *                      It is recommended to leave this enabled. In previous versions of
 *                      MediaWiki, some users set this to false to allow images to be added to
 *                      the wiki by copying them into $wgUploadDirectory and then running
 *                      maintenance/rebuildImages.php to register them in the database.
 *                      This is no longer supported, use maintenance/importImages.php instead.
 *
 *                      Default: 2.
 *   - deletedHashLevels
 *                      Optional 'hashLevels' override for the 'deleted' zone.
 *   - thumbScriptUrl   The URL for thumb.php (optional, not recommended)
 *   - transformVia404  Whether to skip media file transformation on parse and rely on a 404
 *                      handler instead.
 *   - initialCapital   Equivalent to $wgCapitalLinks (or $wgCapitalLinkOverrides[NS_FILE],
 *                      determines whether filenames implicitly start with a capital letter.
 *                      The current implementation may give incorrect description page links
 *                      when the local $wgCapitalLinks and initialCapital are mismatched.
 *   - pathDisclosureProtection
 *                      May be 'paranoid' to remove all parameters from error messages, 'none' to
 *                      leave the paths in unchanged, or 'simple' to replace paths with
 *                      placeholders. Default for LocalRepo is 'simple'.
 *   - fileMode         This allows wikis to set the file mode when uploading/moving files. Default
 *                      is 0644.
 *   - directory        The local filesystem directory where public files are stored. Not used for
 *                      some remote repos.
 *   - thumbDir         The base thumbnail directory. Defaults to "<directory>/thumb".
 *   - thumbUrl         The base thumbnail URL. Defaults to "<url>/thumb".
 *   - isPrivate        Set this if measures should always be taken to keep the files private.
 *                      One should not trust this to assure that the files are not web readable;
 *                      the server configuration should be done manually depending on the backend.

/**
 * File backend structure configuration.
 *
 * This is an array of file backend configuration arrays.
 * Each backend configuration has the following parameters:
 *  - name        : A unique name for the backend
 *  - class       : The file backend class to use
 *  - wikiId      : A unique string that identifies the wiki (container prefix)
 *  - lockManager : The name of a lock manager (see $wgLockManagers) [optional]
 *  - fileJournal : File journal configuration for FileJournal::__construct() [optional]
 *
 * See FileBackend::__construct() for more details.
 * Additional parameters are specific to the file backend class used.
 * These settings should be global to all wikis when possible.
 *
 * FileBackendMultiWrite::__construct() is augmented with a 'template' option that
 * can be used in any of the values of the 'backends' array. Its value is the name of
 * another backend in $wgFileBackends. When set, it pre-fills the array with all of the
 * configuration of the named backend. Explicitly set values in the array take precedence.
 *
 * There are two particularly important aspects about each backend:
 *   - a) Whether it is fully qualified or wiki-relative.
 *        By default, the paths of files are relative to the current wiki,
 *        which works via prefixing them with the current wiki ID when accessed.
 *        Setting 'domainId' forces the backend to be fully qualified by prefixing
 *        all paths with the specified value instead. This can be useful if
 *        multiple wikis need to share the same data. Note that 'name' is *not*
 *        part of any prefix and thus should not be relied upon for namespacing.
 *   - b) Whether it is only defined for some wikis or is defined on all
 *        wikis in the wiki farm. Defining a backend globally is useful
 *        if multiple wikis need to share the same data.
 * One should be aware of these aspects when configuring a backend for use with
 * any basic feature or plugin. For example, suppose an extension stores data for
 * different wikis in different directories and sometimes needs to access data from
 * a foreign wiki's directory in order to render a page on given wiki. The extension
 * would need a fully qualified backend that is defined on all wikis in the wiki farm.

 * maintain "best effort" linearizability; as long as connectivity is strong, latency is low,
 * and there is no eviction pressure prompted by low free space, those operations should be
 * linearizable. In terms of PACELC (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PACELC_theorem), the store
 * should act as a PA/EL distributed system for these operations. One optimization for these
 * operations is to route them to a "primary" data-center (e.g. one that serves HTTP POST) for
 * synchronous execution and then replicate to the others asynchronously. This means that at
 * least calls to these operations during HTTP POST requests would quickly return.
 *
 * All other operations, such as get(), set(), delete(), changeTTL(), incr(), and decr(),
 * should be synchronous in the local data-center, replicating asynchronously to the others.
 * This behavior can be overriden by the use of the WRITE_SYNC and READ_LATEST flags.
 *
 * The store should *preferably* have eventual consistency to handle network partitions.
 *
 * Modules that rely on the stash should be prepared for:
 *   - add(), merge(), lock(), and unlock() to be slower than other write operations,
 *     at least in "secondary" data-centers (e.g. one that only serves HTTP GET/HEAD)
 *   - Other write operations to have race conditions accross data-centers
 *   - Read operations to have race conditions accross data-centers
 *   - Consistency to be either eventual (with Last-Write-Wins) or just "best effort"
 *
 * In general, this means avoiding updates during idempotent HTTP requests (GET/HEAD) and
 * avoiding assumptions of true linearizability (e.g. accepting anomalies). Modules that need
 * these kind of guarantees should use other storage mediums.

/**
 * Define extra client-side modules to be registered with ResourceLoader.
 *
 * NOTE: It is recommended to define modules in extension.json or skin.json
 * whenever possible.
 *
 * ## Using resource modules
 *
 * By default modules are registered as an instance of ResourceLoaderFileModule.
 * You find the relevant code in resources/Resources.php. These are the options:
 *
 * ### class
 *
 * Alternate subclass of ResourceLoaderModule (rather than default ResourceLoaderFileModule).
 * If this is used, some of the other properties may not apply, and you can specify your
 * own arguments. Since MediaWiki 1.30, it may now specify a callback function as an
 * alternative to a plain class name, using the factory key in the module description array.
 * This allows dependency injection to be used for %ResourceLoader modules.
 *
 * Class name of alternate subclass
 *
 * @par Example:
 * @code
 *   $wgResourceModules['ext.myExtension'] = [
 *     'class' => ResourceLoaderWikiModule::class,
 *   ];
 * @endcode
 *
 * ### debugScripts
 *
 * Scripts to include in debug contexts.
 *
 * %File path string or array of file path strings.
 *
 * @par Example:
 * @code
 *   $wgResourceModules['ext.myExtension'] = [
 *     'debugScripts' => 'resources/MyExtension/debugMyExt.js',
 *   ];
 * @endcode
 *
 * ### dependencies
 *
 * Modules which must be loaded before this module.
 *
 * Module name string or array of module name strings.
 *
 * @par Example:
 * @code
 *   $wgResourceModules['ext.myExtension'] = [
 *     'dependencies' => [ 'jquery.cookie', 'mediawiki.util' ],
 *   ];
 * @endcode
 *
 * ### deprecated
 *
 * Whether the module is deprecated and usage is discouraged.
 *
 * Either a boolean, or a string or an object with key message can be used to customise
 * deprecation message.
 *
 * @par Example:
 * @code
 *   $wgResourceModules['ext.myExtension'] = [
 *     'deprecated' => 'You should use ext.myExtension2 instead',
 *   ];
 * @endcode
 *
 * ### group
 *
 * Group which this module should be loaded together with.
 *
 * Group name string.
 *
 * @par Example:
 * @code
 *   $wgResourceModules['ext.myExtension'] = [
 *     'group' => 'myExtGroup',
 *   ];
 * @endcode
 *
 * See also
 * [Groups](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/ResourceLoader/Features#Groups)
 * on mediawiki.org.
 *
 * ### languageScripts
 *
 * Scripts to include in specific language contexts. See the scripts option below for an
 * example.
 *
 * Array keyed by language code containing file path string or array of file path strings.
 *
 * ### localBasePath
 *
 * Base path to prepend to all local paths in $options. Defaults to $IP.
 *
 * Base path string
 *
 * @par Example:
 * @code
 *   $wgResourceModules['ext.myExtension'] = [
 *     'localBasePath' => __DIR__,
 *   ];
 * @endcode
 *
 * ### messages
 *
 * Messages to always load
 *
 * Array of message key strings.
 *
 * @par Example:
 * @code
 *   $wgResourceModules['ext.myExtension'] = [
 *     'messages' => [
 *       'searchsuggest-search',
 *       'searchsuggest-containing',
 *     ],
 *   ];
 * @endcode
 *
 * ### noflip
 *
 * Whether to skip CSSJanus LTR-to-RTL flipping for this module. Recommended for styles
 * imported from libraries that already properly handle their RTL styles. Default is false,
 * meaning CSSJanus will be applied on RTL-mode output.
 *
 * Boolean.
 *
 * @par Example:
 * @code
 *   $wgResourceModules['ext.myExtension'] = [
 *     'noflip' => true,
 *   ];
 * @endcode
 *
 * ### packageFiles
 *
 * Package files that can be require()d. 'packageFiles' cannot be combined with any of the
 * scripts options: 'scripts', 'languageScripts' and 'debugScripts'.
 *
 * String or array of package file.
 *
 * ### remoteBasePath
 *
 * Base path to prepend to all remote paths in $options. Defaults to $wgScriptPath.
 * Cannot be combined with remoteExtPath.

 *     'remoteExtPath' => 'MyExtension',
 *   ];
 * @endcode
 *
 * ### scripts
 *
 * Scripts to always include.
 *
 * %File path string or array of file path strings.
 *
 * @par Example:
 * @code
 *   $wgResourceModules['ext.myExtension'] = [
 *     'languageScripts' => [

 *
 * Styles to include in specific skin contexts. (mapping of skin name to style(s))
 * See $wgResourceModuleSkinStyles below for an example.
 *
 * Array keyed by skin name containing file path string or array of file path strings.
 *
 * ### skipFunction
 *
 * Function that returns true when the module should be skipped. Intended for when the
 * module provides a polyfill that is not required in modern browsers
 *
 * Filename of a JavaScript file with a top-level return (it should not be wrapped in a
 * function).
 *
 * @par Example:
 * @code

 * @endcode
 *
 * ### styles
 *
 * Styles to always include in the module.
 *
 * %File path string or list of file path strings. The included file can be automatically
 * wrapped in a @media query by specifying the file path as the key in an object, with
 * the value specifying the media query.
 *
 * See $wgResourceModuleSkinStyles below for additional examples.
 *
 * @par Example:
 * @code
 *   $wgResourceModules['example'] = [

 *     'targets' => [ 'desktop', 'mobile' ],
 *   ];
 * @endcode
 *
 * ### templates
 *
 * Templates to be loaded for client-side usage.
 *
 * Object or array of templates.
 *
 * @par Example:
 * @code
 *   $wgResourceModules['ext.myExtension'] = [
 *     'templates' => [

 *   $wgResourceModuleSkinStyles['foo'] = [

 * ]
 * where <group> is a user group, <policy> is a password policy name
 * (arbitrary string) defined in the 'checks' part, <callback> is the
 * PHP callable implementing the policy check, <settings> is an array
 * of options with the following keys:
 * - value: (number, boolean or null) the value to pass to the callback
 * - forceChange: (bool, default false) if the password is invalid, do
 *   not let the user log in without changing the password
 * - suggestChangeOnLogin: (bool, default false) if true and the password is
 *   invalid, suggest a password change if logging in. If all the failing policies
 *   that apply to the user have this set to false, the password change
 *   screen will not be shown. 'forceChange' takes precedence over
 *   'suggestChangeOnLogin' if they are both present.
 * As a shorthand for [ 'value' => <value> ], simply <value> can be written.
 * When multiple password policies are defined for a user, the settings
 * arrays are merged, and for fields which are set in both arrays, the
 * larger value (as understood by PHP's 'max' method) is taken.
 *
 * A user's effective policy is the superset of all policy statements
 * from the policies for the groups where the user is a member. If more
 * than one group policy include the same policy statement, the value is
 * the max() of the values. Note true > false. The 'default' policy group
 * is required, and serves as the minimum policy for all users.
 *
 * Callbacks receive three arguments: the policy value, the User object
 * and the password; and must return a StatusValue. A non-good status
 * means the password will not be accepted for new accounts, and existing
 * accounts will be prompted for password change or barred from logging in
 * (depending on whether the status is a fatal or merely error/warning).
 *
 * The checks supported by core are:
 *	- MinimalPasswordLength - Minimum length a user can set.
 *	- MinimumPasswordLengthToLogin - Passwords shorter than this will
 *		not be allowed to login, or offered a chance to reset their password
 *		as part of the login workflow, regardless if it is correct.
 *	- MaximalPasswordLength - maximum length password a user is allowed
 *		to attempt. Prevents DoS attacks with pbkdf2.
 *	- PasswordCannotMatchUsername - Password cannot match the username.
 *	- PasswordCannotBeSubstringInUsername - Password cannot be a substring
 *		(contained within) the username.
 *	- PasswordCannotMatchBlacklist - Username/password combination cannot
 *		match a list of default passwords used by MediaWiki in the past.
 *		Deprecated since 1.35, use PasswordCannotMatchDefaults instead.
 *	- PasswordCannotMatchDefaults - Username/password combination cannot
 *		match a list of default passwords used by MediaWiki in the past.
 *	- PasswordNotInLargeBlacklist - Password not in best practices list of
 *		100,000 commonly used passwords. Due to the size of the list this
 *		is a probabilistic test.
 *		Deprecated since 1.35, use PasswordNotInCommonList instead.
 *	- PasswordNotInCommonList - Password not in best practices list of
 *		100,000 commonly used passwords. Due to the size of the list this
 *		is a probabilistic test.
 *
 * If you add custom checks, for Special:PasswordPolicies to display them correctly,
 * every check should have a corresponding passwordpolicies-policy-<check> message,
 * and every settings field other than 'value' should have a corresponding
 * passwordpolicies-policyflag-<flag> message (<check> and <flag> are in lowercase).
 * The check message receives the policy value as a parameter, the flag message
 * receives the flag value (or values if it's an array).
