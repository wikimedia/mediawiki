/**
 * File repository structures
 *
 * $wgLocalFileRepo is a single repository structure, and $wgForeignFileRepos is
 * an array of such structures. Each repository structure is an associative
 * array of properties configuring the repository.
 *
 * Properties required for all repos:
 *   - class            The class name for the repository. May come from the core or an extension.
 *                      The core repository classes are FileRepo, LocalRepo, ForeignDBRepo.
 *                      FSRepo is also supported for backwards compatibility.
 *
 *   - name             A unique name for the repository (but $wgLocalFileRepo should be 'local').
 *                      The name should consist of alpha-numeric characters.
 *   - backend          A file backend name (see $wgFileBackends).
 *
 * For most core repos:
 *   - zones            Associative array of zone names that each map to an array with:
 *                          container  : backend container name the zone is in
 *                          directory  : root path within container for the zone
 *                          url        : base URL to the root of the zone
 *                          urlsByExt  : map of file extension types to base URLs
 *                                       (useful for using a different cache for videos)
 *                          handlerUrl : base script-handled URL to the root of the zone
 *                                       (see FileRepo::getZoneHandlerUrl() function)
 *                      Zones default to using "<repo name>-<zone name>" as the container name
 *                      and default to using the container root as the zone's root directory.
 *                      Nesting of zone locations within other zones should be avoided.
 *   - url              Public zone URL. The 'zones' settings take precedence.
 *   - hashLevels       The number of directory levels for hash-based division of files
 *   - thumbScriptUrl   The URL for thumb.php (optional, not recommended)
 *   - transformVia404  Whether to skip media file transformation on parse and rely on a 404
 *                      handler instead.
 *   - initialCapital   Equivalent to $wgCapitalLinks (or $wgCapitalLinkOverrides[NS_FILE],
 *                      determines whether filenames implicitly start with a capital letter.
 *                      The current implementation may give incorrect description page links
 *                      when the local $wgCapitalLinks and initialCapital are mismatched.
 *   - pathDisclosureProtection
 *                      May be 'paranoid' to remove all parameters from error messages, 'none' to
 *                      leave the paths in unchanged, or 'simple' to replace paths with
 *                      placeholders. Default for LocalRepo is 'simple'.
 *   - fileMode         This allows wikis to set the file mode when uploading/moving files. Default
 *                      is 0644.
 *   - directory        The local filesystem directory where public files are stored. Not used for
 *                      some remote repos.
 *   - thumbDir         The base thumbnail directory. Defaults to "<directory>/thumb".
 *   - thumbUrl         The base thumbnail URL. Defaults to "<url>/thumb".
 *   - isPrivate        Set this if measures should always be taken to keep the files private.
 *                      One should not trust this to assure that the files are not web readable;
 *                      the server configuration should be done manually depending on the backend.
 *
 * These settings describe a foreign MediaWiki installation. They are optional, and will be ignored
 * for local repositories:
 *   - descBaseUrl       URL of image description pages, e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:
 *   - scriptDirUrl      URL of the MediaWiki installation, equivalent to $wgScriptPath, e.g.
 *                       http://en.wikipedia.org/w
 *   - scriptExtension   Script extension of the MediaWiki installation, equivalent to
 *                       $wgScriptExtension, e.g. .php5 defaults to .php
 *
 *   - articleUrl        Equivalent to $wgArticlePath, e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/$1
 *   - fetchDescription  Fetch the text of the remote file description page. Equivalent to
 *                       $wgFetchCommonsDescriptions.
 *   - abbrvThreshold    File names over this size will use the short form of thumbnail names.
 *                       Short thumbnail names only have the width, parameters, and the extension.
 *
 * ForeignDBRepo:
 *   - dbType, dbServer, dbUser, dbPassword, dbName, dbFlags
 *                       equivalent to the corresponding member of $wgDBservers
 *   - tablePrefix       Table prefix, the foreign wiki's $wgDBprefix
 *   - hasSharedCache    True if the wiki's shared cache is accessible via the local $wgMemc
 *
 * ForeignAPIRepo:
 *   - apibase              Use for the foreign API's URL
 *   - apiThumbCacheExpiry  How long to locally cache thumbs for
 *

/**
 * File backend structure configuration.
 *
 * This is an array of file backend configuration arrays.
 * Each backend configuration has the following parameters:
 *  - 'name'         : A unique name for the backend
 *  - 'class'        : The file backend class to use
 *  - 'wikiId'       : A unique string that identifies the wiki (container prefix)
 *  - 'lockManager'  : The name of a lock manager (see $wgLockManagers)
 *
 * See FileBackend::__construct() for more details.
 * Additional parameters are specific to the file backend class used.
 * These settings should be global to all wikis when possible.
 *
 * There are two particularly important aspects about each backend:
 *   - a) Whether it is fully qualified or wiki-relative.
 *        By default, the paths of files are relative to the current wiki,
 *        which works via prefixing them with the current wiki ID when accessed.
 *        Setting 'wikiId' forces the backend to be fully qualified by prefixing
 *        all paths with the specified value instead. This can be useful if
 *        multiple wikis need to share the same data. Note that 'name' is *not*
 *        part of any prefix and thus should not be relied upon for namespacing.
 *   - b) Whether it is only defined for some wikis or is defined on all
 *        wikis in the wiki farm. Defining a backend globally is useful
 *        if multiple wikis need to share the same data.
 * One should be aware of these aspects when configuring a backend for use with
 * any basic feature or plugin. For example, suppose an extension stores data for
 * different wikis in different directories and sometimes needs to access data from
 * a foreign wiki's directory in order to render a page on given wiki. The extension
 * would need a fully qualified backend that is defined on all wikis in the wiki farm.
