When translating messages with wfMsg(), it is not always clear what should
be considered UI messages and what shoud be content messages. 

For example, for regular wikipedia site like en, there should be only one 
'mainpage', therefore when getting the link of 'mainpage', we should 
treate it as content of the site and call wfMsgForContent(), while for 
rendering the text of the link, we call wfMsg(). The code in default
behaves this way. However, sites like common do offer different versions 
of 'mainpage' and the like for different languages. This array provides a
way to override the default behavior. For example, to allow language specific
mainpage and community portal, set

$wgForceUIMsgAsContentMsg = array( 'mainpage', 'portal-url' );
