/**
 * CSRF attacks (where a malicious website uses frames, <img> tags, or
 * similar, to prompt a wiki user to open a wiki page or submit a form,
 * without being aware of doing so) are most easily countered by using
 * tokens.  For normal browsing, loading the form for a protected action 
 * sets two copies of a random string: one in the $_SESSION, and one as 
 * a hidden field in the form.  When the form is submitted, it checks 
 * that a) the set of cookies submitted with the form *has* a copy of 
 * the session cookie, and b) that it matches.  Since malicious websites
 * don't have control over the session cookies, they can't craft a form
 * that can be instantly submitted which will have the appropriate tokens. 
 * 
 * Note that these tokens are distinct from those in User::setToken(), which
 * are used for persistent session authentication and are retained for as 
 * long as the user is logged in to the wiki.  These tokens are to protect
 * one individual action, and should ideally be cleared once the action is over.
