/**
 * Resort normal UTF-8 order by putting a bunch of stuff in PUA
 *
 * This takes a bunch of characters (The alphabet) that should,
 * be together, and converts them all to private-use-area characters
 * so that they are all sorted in the right order relative to each
 * other.
 *
 * This renumbers characters starting at U+F3000 (Chosen to avoid
 * conflicts with other people using private use area)
 *
 * This does not support fancy things like secondary differences, etc.
 * (It supports digraphs, trigraphs etc. though.)
 *
 * It is expected most people will subclass this and just override the
 * constructor to hard-code an alphabet.
