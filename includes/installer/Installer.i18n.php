В MediaWiki легко просмотреть последних изменений и, при необходимости, откатить любой ущерб сделанный злоумышленниками или наивными пользователями.

Однако, движок MediaWiki можно использовать и иными способами, и не далеко не всех удаётся убедить в преимуществах открытой вики-работы.
Так что в вас есть выбор.

Конфигурация '''«{{int:config-profile-wiki}}»''' позволяет всем править страницы даже не регистрируясь на сайте. Конфигурация '''{{int:config-profile-no-anon}}''' обеспечивает дополнительный учёт, но может отсечь случайных участников.

Сценарий '''«{{int:config-profile-fishbowl}}»''' разрешает редактирование только определённым участникам, но общедоступным остаётся просмотр страниц, в том числе просмотр истории изменения. В режиме '''«{{int:config-profile-private}}»''' просмотр страниц разрешён только определённым пользователям, какая-то их часть может иметь также права на редактирование.

Более сложные схемы разграничения прав можно настроить после установки, см. [//www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:User_rights соответствующее руководство].",
