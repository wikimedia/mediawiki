/**
 * Interface for database access objects.
 *
 * Classes using this support a set of constants in a bitfield argument to their data loading
 * functions. In general, objects should assume READ_NORMAL if no flags are explicitly given,
 * though certain objects may assume READ_LATEST for common use case or legacy reasons.
 *
 * There are four types of reads:
 *   - READ_NORMAL    : Potentially cached read of data (e.g. from a replica DB or stale replica)
 *   - READ_LATEST    : Up-to-date read as of transaction start (e.g. from master or a quorum read)
 *   - READ_LOCKING   : Up-to-date read as of now, that locks (shared) the records
 *   - READ_EXCLUSIVE : Up-to-date read as of now, that locks (exclusive) the records
 * All record locks persist for the duration of the transaction.
 *
 * A special constant READ_LATEST_IMMUTABLE can be used for fetching append-only data. Such
 * data is either (a) on a replica DB and up-to-date or (b) not yet there, but on the master/quorum.
 * Because the data is append-only, it can never be stale on a replica DB if present.
 *
 * Callers should use READ_NORMAL (or pass in no flags) unless the read determines a write.
 * In theory, such cases may require READ_LOCKING, though to avoid contention, READ_LATEST is
 * often good enough. If UPDATE race condition checks are required on a row and expensive code
 * must run after the row is fetched to determine the UPDATE, it may help to do something like:
 *   - a) Start transaction
 *   - b) Read the current row with READ_LATEST
 *   - c) Determine the new row (expensive, so we don't want to hold locks now)
 *   - d) Re-read the current row with READ_LOCKING; if it changed then bail out
 *   - e) otherwise, do the updates
 *   - f) Commit transaction
