	 *                job completion will not appear to be exactly FIFO if there are multiple
	 *                job runners since jobs can take different times to finish once popped.
	 *                If "timestamp" is used, the queue will at least be loosely ordered
	 *                by timestamp, allowing for some jobs to be popped off out of order.
	 *                If "random" is used, pop() will pick jobs in random order. This might be
	 *                useful for improving concurrency depending on the queue storage medium.

	 *                but not acknowledged as completed after this many seconds. Recycling
	 *                of jobs simple means re-inserting them into the queue. Jobs can be

	 * Register the "root job" of a given job into the queue for de-duplication.
	 * This should only be called right *after* all the new jobs have been inserted.
	 * This is used to turn older, duplicate, job entries into no-ops. The root job
	 * information will remain in the registry until it simply falls out of cache.
	 *
	 * This requires that $job has two special fields in the "params" array:
	 *   - rootJobSignature : hash (e.g. SHA1) that identifies the task
	 *   - rootJobTimestamp : TS_MW timestamp of this instance of the task
	 *
	 * A "root job" is a conceptual job that consist of potentially many smaller jobs
	 * that are actually inserted into the queue. For example, "refreshLinks" jobs are
	 * spawned when a template is edited. One can think of the task as "update links
	 * of pages that use template X" and an instance of that task as a "root job".
	 * However, what actually goes into the queue are potentially many refreshLinks2 jobs.
	 * Since these jobs include things like page ID ranges and DB master positions, and morph
	 * into smaller refreshLinks2 jobs recursively, simple duplicate detection (like job_sha1)
	 * for individual jobs being identical is not useful.
	 *
	 * In the case of "refreshLinks", if these jobs are still in the queue when the template
	 * is edited again, we want all of these old refreshLinks jobs for that template to become
	 * no-ops. This can greatly reduce server load, since refreshLinks jobs involves parsing.
	 * Essentially, the new batch of jobs belong to a new "root job" and the older ones to a
	 * previous "root job" for the same task of "update links of pages that use template X".
