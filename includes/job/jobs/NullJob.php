/**
 * Degenerate job that does nothing, but can optionally replace itself
 * in the queue and/or sleep for a brief time period. These can be used
 * to represent "no-op" jobs or test lock contention and performance.
 *
 * @par Example:
 * Inserting a null job in the configured job queue:
 * @code
 * $ php maintenance/eval.php
 * > $queue = JobQueueGroup::singleton();
 * > $job = new NullJob( Title::newMainPage(), array( 'lives' => 10 ) );
 * > $queue->push( $job );
 * @endcode
 * You can then confirm the job has been enqueued by using the showJobs.php
 * maintenance utility:
 * @code
 * $ php maintenance/showJobs.php --group
 * null: 1 queue; 0 claimed (0 active, 0 abandoned)
 * $
 * @endcode
 *
 * @ingroup JobQueue
