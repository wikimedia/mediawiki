 * Support for external editors to modify both text and files
 * in external applications. It works as follows: MediaWiki
 * sends a meta-file with the MIME type 'application/x-external-editor'
 * to the client. The user has to associate that MIME type with
 * a helper application (a reference implementation in Perl
 * can be found in extensions/ee), which will launch the editor,
 * and save the modified data back to the server.
