	/**
	 * Instantiate an object based on a specification array.
	 *
	 * The specification array must contain a 'class' key with string value
	 * that specifies the class name to instantiate or a 'factory' key with
	 * a callable (is_callable() === true). It can optionally contain
	 * an 'args' key that provides arguments to pass to the
	 * constructor/callable.
	 *
	 * Object construction using a specification having both 'class' and
	 * 'args' members will call the constructor of the class using
	 * ReflectionClass::newInstanceArgs. The use of ReflectionClass carries
	 * a performance penalty and should not be used to create large numbers of
	 * objects. If this is needed, consider introducing a factory method that
	 * can be called via call_user_func_array() instead.
	 *
	 * Values in the arguments collection which are Closure instances will be
	 * expanded by invoking them with no arguments before passing the
	 * resulting value on to the constructor/callable. This can be used to
	 * pass DatabaseBase instances or other live objects to the
	 * constructor/callable. This behavior can be suppressed by adding
	 * closure_expansion => false to the specification.
	 *
	 * @param array $spec Object specification
	 * @return object
	 * @throws InvalidArgumentException when object specification does not
	 * contain 'class' or 'factory' keys
	 * @throws ReflectionException when 'args' are supplied and 'class'
