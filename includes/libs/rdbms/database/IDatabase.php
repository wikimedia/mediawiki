	 * name. If an array is given, table aliases can be specified, for example:
	 *
	 *    [ 'a' => 'user' ]
	 *
	 * This includes the user table in the query, with the alias "a" available
	 * for use in field names (e.g. a.user_name).
	 *
	 * A derived table, defined by the result of selectSQLText(), requires an alias
	 * key and a Subquery instance value which wraps the SQL query, for example:
	 *
	 *    [ 'c' => new Subquery( 'SELECT ...' ) ]
	 *
	 * Joins using parentheses for grouping (since MediaWiki 1.31) may be
	 * constructed using nested arrays. For example,
	 *
	 *    [ 'tableA', 'nestedB' => [ 'tableB', 'b2' => 'tableB2' ] ]

	 * will produce SQL something like
	 *
	 *    FROM tableA LEFT JOIN (tableB JOIN tableB2 AS b2 ON (b_id = b2_id)) ON (b_a = a_id)
	 *
	 * All of the table names given here are automatically run through
	 * Database::tableName(), which causes the table prefix (if any) to be
	 * added, and various other table name mappings to be performed.
	 *
	 * Do not use untrusted user input as a table name. Alias names should
	 * not have characters outside of the Basic multilingual plane.
	 *
	 * @param string|array $vars
	 *
	 * May be either a field name or an array of field names. The field names
	 * can be complete fragments of SQL, for direct inclusion into the SELECT
	 * query. If an array is given, field aliases can be specified, for example:
	 *
	 *   [ 'maxrev' => 'MAX(rev_id)' ]
	 *
	 * This includes an expression with the alias "maxrev" in the query.
	 *
	 * If an expression is given, care must be taken to ensure that it is
	 * DBMS-independent.
	 *
	 * Untrusted user input must not be passed to this parameter.
	 *
	 * @param string|array $conds
	 *
	 * May be either a string containing a single condition, or an array of
	 * conditions. If an array is given, the conditions constructed from each
	 * element are combined with AND.
	 *
	 * Array elements may take one of two forms:
	 *
	 *   - Elements with a numeric key are interpreted as raw SQL fragments.
	 *   - Elements with a string key are interpreted as equality conditions,
	 *     where the key is the field name.
	 *     - If the value of such an array element is a scalar (such as a
	 *       string), it will be treated as data and thus quoted appropriately.
	 *       If it is null, an IS NULL clause will be added.
	 *     - If the value is an array, an IN (...) clause will be constructed
	 *       from its non-null elements, and an IS NULL clause will be added
	 *       if null is present, such that the field may match any of the
	 *       elements in the array. The non-null elements will be quoted.
	 *
	 * Note that expressions are often DBMS-dependent in their syntax.
	 * DBMS-independent wrappers are provided for constructing several types of
	 * expression commonly used in condition queries. See:
	 *    - IDatabase::buildLike()
	 *    - IDatabase::conditional()
	 *
	 * Untrusted user input is safe in the values of string keys, however untrusted
	 * input must not be used in the array key names or in the values of numeric keys.
	 * Escaping of untrusted input used in values of numeric keys should be done via
	 * IDatabase::addQuotes()
	 *
	 * @param string|array $options
	 *
	 * Optional: Array of query options. Boolean options are specified by
	 * including them in the array as a string value with a numeric key, for
	 * example:
	 *
	 *    [ 'FOR UPDATE' ]
	 *
	 * The supported options are:
	 *
	 *   - OFFSET: Skip this many rows at the start of the result set. OFFSET
	 *     with LIMIT can theoretically be used for paging through a result set,
	 *     but this is discouraged for performance reasons.
	 *
	 *   - LIMIT: Integer: return at most this many rows. The rows are sorted
	 *     and then the first rows are taken until the limit is reached. LIMIT
	 *     is applied to a result set after OFFSET.
	 *
	 *   - FOR UPDATE: Boolean: lock the returned rows so that they can't be
	 *     changed until the next COMMIT.
	 *
	 *   - DISTINCT: Boolean: return only unique result rows.
	 *
	 *   - GROUP BY: May be either an SQL fragment string naming a field or
	 *     expression to group by, or an array of such SQL fragments.
	 *
