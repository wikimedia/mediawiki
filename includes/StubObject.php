/**
 * Class to implement stub globals, which are globals that delay loading the
 * their associated module code by deferring initialisation until the first
 * method call.
 *
 * Note on unstub loops:
 *
 * Unstub loops (infinite recursion) sometimes occur when a constructor calls
 * another function, and the other function calls some method of the stub. The
 * best way to avoid this is to make constructors as lightweight as possible,
 * deferring any initialisation which depends on other modules. As a last
 * resort, you can use StubObject::isRealObject() to break the loop, but as a
 * general rule, the stub object mechanism should be transparent, and code
 * which refers to it should be kept to a minimum.
