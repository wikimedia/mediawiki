/**
 * A secondary provider mostly acts when the submitted authentication data has
 * already been associated to a MediaWiki user account.
 *
 * For login, a secondary provider performs additional authentication steps
 * after a PrimaryAuthenticationProvider has identified which MediaWiki user is
 * trying to log in. For example, it might implement a password reset, request
 * the second factor for two-factor auth, or prevent the login if the account is blocked.
 *
 * For account creation, a secondary provider performs optional extra steps after
 * a PrimaryAuthenticationProvider has created the user; for example, it can collect
 * further user information such as a biography.
 *
 * (For account linking, secondary providers are not involved.)
 *
 * This interface also provides methods for changing authentication data such
 * as a second-factor token, and callbacks that are invoked after login / account creation
 * succeeded or failed.
