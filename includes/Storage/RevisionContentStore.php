/**
 * Service interface for storing Content objects associated with a revision.
 *
 * Content objects for each revision are organized into "slots". Each revision can have
 * only one Content object per slot.
 *
 * Slots come in several varieties:
 * - Immutable slots for primary data. Immutable slots cannot be updated, only superseded in a
 *   subsequent revision. Attempting to modify an immutable slot will cause a NotMutableException
 *   to be thrown.
 * - Mutable slots for derived data. Mutable slots of an existing revision can be updated.
 *   Some mutable slots may be configured to be volatile, meaning that the data stored there
 *   may become unavailable at some point.
 * - Virtual slots for content that is generated on demand. Virtual slots cannot read, but not
 *   written.  Attempting to modify a virtual slot will cause a NotMutableException
 *   to be thrown.
 *
 * @todo: decide whether we should expose blob addresses here. This would allow explicit linking
 *        of virtual content, and allow extensions to access blobs directly.
 *
 * @todo: explore a stateful builder/interactor variant of this interface, for modeling a
 *        transactional context. It would have startCreate/startUpdate for starting, and save/abort for
 *        ending the transaction, in addition to methods for adding Content, etc.
