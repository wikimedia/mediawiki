/**
 * A wrapper class which causes Xml::encodeJsVar() and Xml::encodeJsCall() to
 * interpret a given string as being a JavaScript expression, instead of string
 * data.
 *
 * @par Example:
 * @code
 *     Xml::encodeJsVar( new XmlJsCode( 'a + b' ) );
 * @endcode
 *
 * This returns "a + b".
 *
 * @note As of 1.21, XmlJsCode objects cannot be nested inside objects or arrays. The sole
 *       exception is the $args argument to Xml::encodeJsCall() because Xml::encodeJsVar() is
 *       called for each individual element in that array.
 *
 * @since 1.17
