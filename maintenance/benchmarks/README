This directory hold several benchmarking scripts used as a proof of speed
or to track PHP performances over time.

To get somehow accurate result, you might want to bound the PHP process
to a specific CPU with `taskset` and raise its priority with `nice`. Example:

 $ taskset 1 nice -n-10 php bench_wfIsWindows.php
