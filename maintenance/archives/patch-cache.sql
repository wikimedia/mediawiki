-- Add 'last touched' fields to cur and user tables.
-- These are useful for maintaining cache consistency.
-- (Updates to OutputPage.php and elsewhere.)
--
-- cur_touched should be set to the current time whenever:
--  * the page is updated
--  * a linked page is created
--  * a linked page is destroyed
--
-- The cur_touched time will then be compared against the
-- timestamps of cached pages to ensure consistency; if
-- cur_touched is later, the page must be regenerated.

ALTER TABLE /*$wgDBprefix*/cur
  ADD COLUMN cur_touched char(14) binary NOT NULL default '';

-- Existing pages should be initialized to the current
-- time so they don't needlessly rerender until they are
-- changed for the first time:

UPDATE /*$wgDBprefix*/cur
  SET cur_touched=NOW()+0;

-- user_touched should be set to the current time whenever:
--  * the user logs in
--  * the user saves preferences (if no longer default...?)
--  * the user's newtalk status is altered
--
-- The user_touched time should also be checked against the
-- timestamp reported by a browser requesting revalidation.
-- If user_touched is later than the reported last modified
-- time, the page should be rerendered with new options and
-- sent again.

ALTER TABLE /*$wgDBprefix*/user
  ADD COLUMN user_touched char(14) binary NOT NULL default '';
UPDATE /*$wgDBprefix*/user
  SET user_touched=NOW()+0;
