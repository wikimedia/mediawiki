/**
 * This script lets a command-line user start up the wiki engine and then poke
 * about by issuing PHP commands directly.
 *
 * Unlike eg Python, you need to use a 'return' statement explicitly for the
 * interactive shell to print out the value of the expression. Multiple lines
 * are evaluated separately, so blocks need to be input without a line break.
 * Fatal errors such as use of undeclared functions can kill the shell.
 *
 * To get decent line editing behavior, you should compile PHP with support
 * for GNU readline (pass --with-readline to configure).
