/**
 * Remove pages with only 1 revision from the MediaWiki namespace, without
 * flooding recent changes, delete logs, etc.
 * Irreversible (can't use standard undelete) and does not update link tables
 *
 * This is mainly useful to run before maintenance/update.php when upgrading
 * to 1.9, to prevent flooding recent changes/deletion logs.  It's intended
 * to be conservative, so it's possible that a few entries will be left for
 * deletion by the upgrade script.  It's also possible that it hasn't been
 * tested thouroughly enough, and will delete something it shouldn't; so
 * back up your DB if there's anything in the MediaWiki that is important to
 * you.
