_Flips CSS from LTR to an RTL orienation and vice-versa_

Author: `Lindsey Simon <elsigh@google.com>`

==Introduction==

CSSJanus is CSS parser utility designed to aid the conversion of a website's
layout from left-to-right(LTR) to right-to-left(RTL). The script was born out of
a need to convert CSS for RTL languages when tables are not being used for layout (since tables will automatically reorder TD's in RTL). 
CSSJanus will change most of the obvious CSS property names and their values as
well as some not-so-obvious ones (cursor, background-position %, etc...). 
The script is designed to offer flexibility to account for cases when you do 
not want to change certain rules which exist to account for bidirectional text
display bugs, as well as situations where you may or may not want to flip annotations inside of the background url string.
Note that you can disable CSSJanus from running on an entire class or any 
rule within a class by prepending a /* @noflip */ comment before the rule(s)
you want CSSJanus to ignore.

CSSJanus itself is not always enough to make a website that works in a LTR
language context work in a RTL language all the way, but it is a start. 

==Getting the code==

View the trunk at:

  http://cssjanus.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

Check out the latest development version anonymously with:

{{{
  $ svn checkout http://cssjanus.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ cssjanus
}}} 

==Using==

Usage:
  ./cssjanus.py < file.css > file-rtl.css
Flags:
  --swap_left_right_in_url: Fixes "left"/"right" string within urls.
  Ex: ./cssjanus.py --swap_left_right_in_url < file.css > file_rtl.css
  --swap_ltr_rtl_in_url: Fixes "ltr"/"rtl" string within urls.
  Ex: ./cssjanus.py --swap_ltr_rtl_in_url < file.css > file_rtl.css  
  
If you'd like to make use of the webapp version of cssjanus, you'll need to
download the Google App Engine SDK
  http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html
and also drop a "django" directory into this directory, with the latest svn
from django. You should be good to go with that setup. Please let me know 
otherwise.

==Bugs, Patches==

Patches and bug reports are welcome, just please keep the style
consistent with the original source. If you find a bug, please include a diff
of cssjanus_test.py with the bug included as a new unit test which fails. It
will make understanding and fixing the bug easier.

==Todo==

* Include some helpers for some typical bidi text solutions?
* Aural CSS (azimuth) swapping?
