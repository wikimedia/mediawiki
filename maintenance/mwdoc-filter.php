/**
 * Doxygen filter to show correct member variable types in documentation.
 *
 * Should be set in Doxygen INPUT_FILTER as "php mwdoc-filter.php"
 *
 * Based on
 * <https://virtualtee.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/tip-for-using-doxygen-for-php-code.html>
 *
 * Improved to resolve various bugs and better MediaWiki PHPDoc conventions:
 *
 * - Insert variable name after typehint instead of at end of line so that
 *   documentation text may follow after "@var Type".
 * - Insert typehint into source code before $variable instead of inside the comment
 *   so that Doxygen interprets it.
 * - Strip the text after @var from the output to avoid Doxygen warnings aboug bogus
 *   symbols being documented but not declared or defined.
