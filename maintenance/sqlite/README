SQLite shares the MySQL schema file at maintenance/tables.sql, with a set of 
compatibility regexes to convert MySQL syntax to SQLite syntax:

* BINARY() and VARBINARY() fields are converted to BLOB
* the UNSIGNED modifier is removed
* "INT" fields are converted to "INTEGER"
* ENUM is converted to BLOB
* the BINARY collation modifier is removed
* AUTO_INCREMENT is converted to AUTOINCREMENT
* Any table options are removed
* Truncated indexes are upgraded to full-width indexes
* FULLTEXT indexes are converted to ordinary indexes
