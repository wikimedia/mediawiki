The .sql scripts in this directory are not meant to be run
standalone, although they can be in some cases if you know
what you're doing.  Most of the time you'll want to run the
.php scripts from the command line.  You must run them from
this directory, and the LocalSettings.php file in the
directory above must point to the installation.

The scripts in archive are for updating databases from
older versions of the software.
