== MediaWiki Maintenance ==

The .sql scripts in this directory are not intended to be run standalone,
although this is appropriate in some cases, e.g. manual creation of blank tables
prior to an import.

Most of the PHP scripts need to be run from the command line. Prior to doing so,
ensure that the LocalSettings.php file in the directory above points to the
proper installation.

Certain scripts will require elevated access to the database. In order to
provide this, first create a MySQL user with "all" permissions on the wiki
database, and then place their username and password in an AdminSettings.php
file in the directory above. See AdminSettings.sample for specifics on this.

=== Brief explanation of files ===

A lot of the files in this directory are PHP scripts used to perform various
maintenance tasks on the wiki database, e.g. rebuilding link tables, updating
the search indices, etc. The files in the "archives" directory are used to
upgrade the database schema when updating the software. Some schema definitions
for alternative (as yet unsupported) database management systems are stored
here too.

The "storage" directory contains scripts and resources useful for working with
external storage clusters, and are not likely to be particularly useful to the
vast majority of installations. This directory does contain the compressOld
scripts, however, which can be useful for compacting old data.

=== Maintenance scripts ===

As noted above, these should be run from the command line. Not all scripts are
listed, as some are Wikimedia-specific, and some are not applicable to most
installations.
