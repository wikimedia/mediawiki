/**
 * Doxygen filter to show correct member variable types in documentation.
 *
 * Based on
 * <https://virtualtee.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/tip-for-using-doxygen-for-php-code.html>
 *
 * It has been adapted for MediaWiki to resolve various bugs we experienced
 * from using Doxygen with our coding conventions:
 *
 * - We want to allow documenting class members on a single line by documenting
 *   them as `/** @var SomeType Description here.`, and in long-form as
 *   `/**\n * Description here.\n * @var SomeType`.
 *
 * - PHP does not support native type-hinting of class members. Instead, we document
 *   that using `@var` in the doc blocks above it. However, Doxygen only supports
 *   parsing this from executable code. We achieve this by having the below filter
 *   take the typehint from the doc block and insert it into the source code in
 *   front of `$myvar`, like `protected SomeType $myvar`. This result is technically
 *   invalid PHP code, but Doxygen understands it this way.
