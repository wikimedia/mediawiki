== MediaWiki PHPUnit Tests ==

Some quickie unit tests done with the PHPUnit testing framework. To run the
test suite, run 'make test' in this (maintenance/tests/phpunit) directory.

=== Installation ===

PHPUnit is no longer maintained by PEAR. To get the current version of
PHPUnit, first uninstall any old version of PHPUnit or PHPUnit2 from PEAR, 
then install the current version from phpunit.de like this:

 pear channel-discover pear.phpunit.de
 pear install phpunit/PHPUnit

You also may wish to install this via your normal package mechanism:

 aptitude install phpunit
- or -
 yum install phpunit

=== Notes ===

* Label currently broken tests in the group Broken and they will not be run
by phpunit.  You can add them to the group by putting the following comment at
the top of the file:
 /**
  * @group Broken
  */
* Need to fix some broken tests
