== Things To Do ==

* Most of the tests are named poorly; naming should describe a use case in story-like language, not simply identify the
unit under test. An example would be the difference between testCalculate and testAddingIntegersTogetherWorks.
* Many of the tests make multiple assertions, and are thus not unitary tests. By using data-providers and more use-case
oriented test selection nearly all of these cases can be easily resolved.
* Some of the test files are either incorrectly named or in the wrong folder. Tests should be organized in a mirrored
structure to the source they are testing, and named the same, with the exception of the word "Test" at the end.
* Shared set-up code or base classes are present, but usually named improperly or appear to be poorly factored. Support
code should share as much of the same naming as the code it's supporting, and test and test-case depenencies should be
considered to resolve other shared needs.
