Security reminder: MediaWiki does not require PHP's register_globals. If you
have it on, turn it '''off''' if you can.

== MediaWiki 1.22 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.22 is an alpha-quality branch and is not recommended for use in
production.

=== Configuration changes in 1.22 ===
* $wgRedirectScript was removed. It was unused.
* Removed $wgLocalMessageCacheSerialized, it is now always true.
* $wgVectorUseIconWatch is now enabled by default.
* $wgCascadingRestrictionLevels was added.
* ftps, ssh, sftp, xmpp, sip, sips, tel, sms, bitcoin, magnet, urn, and geo
  have been whitelisted inside of $wgUrlProtocols.
* $wgDocType and $wgDTD have been removed and are no longer used for the DOCTYPE.
* $wgHtml5 is no longer used by core. Setting it to false will no longer disable HTML5.
  It is still set to true for extension compatibility but doing so in extensions is deprecated.
* $wgXhtmlDefaultNamespace is no longer used by core. Setting it will no longer change the
  xmlns used by MediaWiki. Reliance on this variable by extensions is deprecated.
* $wgHandheldStyle was removed.
* $wgHandheldForIPhone was removed.
* $wgJsMimeType is no longer used by core. Most usage has been removed since
  HTML output is now exclusively HTML5.
* $wgDBOracleDRCP added. True enables persistent connection with DRCP on Oracle.
* $wgLogAutopatrol added to allow disabling logging of autopatrol edits in the logging table.
  default for $wgLogAutopatrol is true.
* The 'edit' right no longer allows for editing a user's own CSS and JS.
* New rights 'editmyusercss', 'editmyuserjs', 'viewmywatchlist',
  and 'editmywatchlist' restrict actions that were formerly allowed by default.
  They have been added to the default for $wgGroupPermissions['*'].

=== New features in 1.22 ===
* (bug 44525) mediawiki.jqueryMsg can now parse (whitelisted) HTML elements and attributes.
* (bug 33454) Language::sprintfDate now has a timezone parameter, and supports
  the "eIOPTZ" formatting characters.
* EditWarning: A warning is shown when an editor leaves the edit form without
  saving (enabled by default, users can opt-out via the 'useeditwarning'
  preference). This feature was moved from the Vector extension, and is now part
  of core for all skins. Take care when upgrading that you don't use an older
  version of the Vector extension as this feature may conflict.
* New 'mediawiki.ui' CSS module providing mw-ui-* styles for buttons and a
  compact vertical form layout.
* New versions of login (Special:UserLogin) and create account
  (Special:UserLogin/signup) forms using the "vform" compact vertical form layout.
  These forms use new messages that assume a "Help logging in" link, see
  https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Page_customizations;
  https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Account_creation_user_experience/Strings lists the
  message key changes.
* (bug 23343) Implemented ability to apply IP blocks to the contents of X-Forwarded-For headers
  by adding a new configuration variable $wgApplyIpBlocksToXff (disabled by default).
* The new hook 'APIGetPossibleErrors' to modify the list of possible errors was
  added.
* (bug 25592) LogEventsList::showLogExtract() will now ignore various
  Pager-related WebRequest parameters by default, as this is overwhelmingly
  likely to be what was intended by users of the method. If any caller wishes
  to use these parameters, the new param 'useRequestParams' may be set to true.
* mw.util.addPortletLink: Tooltip is no longer required to be plain (without
  an accesskey in it already). As such it now rountrips. Creating a link with a
  message as tooltip, grabbing the title attribute and using it to create
  another portlet will work as expected.
* (bug 6747) {{ROOTPAGENAME}} introduced, contains the name of the topmost
  page without namespace.
* BREAKING CHANGE: (bug 41729) Display editsection links next to headings. Also
  change their class name from .editsection to .mw-editsection and place them at
  the end of the heading element instead of the beginning. Client-side code and
  screen-scrapers will have to be adjusted to handle both cases (old HTML will
  still be visible on cached page renders until they are purged); extensions
  using the DoEditSectionLink or EditSectionLink hooks might need adjustments as
  well.
* (bug 45535) introduced the new 'LanguageLinks' hook for manipulating the
  language links associated with a page before display.
* Chosen (http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/) was added as module 'jquery.chosen'
* HTMLForm will turn multiselect checkboxes into a Chosen interface when setting cssclass 'mw-chosen'
* rebuildLocalisationCache learned --lang option. Let you rebuild l10n caches
  of the specified languages instead of all of them.
* New GetNewMessagesAlert hook allowing extensions to disable or modify the new
  messages alert
* New wgUserNewMsgRevisionId JS global for logged in users. This will be null
  if the user has no new talk page messages. Otherwise it will be set to the
  revision ID of the oldest new talk page message. This will allow gadgets and
  extensions to create their own new message alerts on the client side.
* mediawiki.log: Added log.warn wrapper (uses console.warn and console.trace).
* mediawiki.log: Implemented log.deprecate. This method defines a property and
  uses ES5 getter/setter to emit a warning when they are used.
* $wgCascadingRestrictionLevels was added, allowing one to specify restriction levels
  which can be cascading (previously 'sysop' was hard-coded as the only one).
* XHTML5 support has been improved. If you set $wgMimeType = 'application/xhtml+xml'
  MediaWiki will try outputting markup acording to XHTML5 rules.
* New hook 'TitleSquidURLs' for manipulating the list of URLs to be purged from
  HTTP caches when a page is changed.
* Changed the patrolling system to always show the link for patrolling in case the
  current revision is patrollable. This also removed the usage of the rcid URI parameters.
* Oracle DB backend now supports Database Resident Connection Pooling (DRCP).
  Can be enabled by setting $wgDBOracleDRCP=true.
  Requires Oracle DB 11gR1 or above, enabled DRCP inside the DB itself and a
  propper connect string.
  More about DRCP can be found at:
  http://www.oracle-base.com/articles/11g/database-resident-connection-pool-11gr1.php
* Add a new parameter $patrolFooterShown to hook ArticleViewFooter so the hook
  handlers can take further action based on the status of the patrol footer
* LinkCache singleton can now be altered or cleared, letting one to specify
  another instance that does not rely on a database backend.
* MediaWiki's PHPUnit tests can now use PHPUnit installed using composer --dev.
* New user rights have been added to increase granularity in rights management
  for extensions such as OAuth:
** editmyusercss controls whether a user may edit their own CSS subpages.
** editmyuserjs controls whether a user may edit their own JS subpages.
** viewmywatchlist controls whether a user may view their watchlist.
** editmywatchlist controls whether a user may edit their watchlist.
* Add new hook AbortTalkPageEmailNotification, this will be used to determine
  whether to send the regular talk page email notification
* (bug 46513) Vector: Add the collapsibleTabs script from the Vector extension.
* Added $wgRecentChangesFlags for defining new flags for RecentChanges and
  watchlists.

=== Bug fixes in 1.22 ===
* Disable Special:PasswordReset when $wgEnableEmail is false. Previously one
  could still navigate to the page by entering the URL directly.
* (bug 47138) Fixed a fatal error when a blocked user tries to automatically
  create an account on login due external authentication in some circumstances.
* (bug 23393) HTML <hN> headings containing line breaks are now handled
  correctly.
* (bug 45803) Whitespace within == Headline == syntax and within <hN> headings
  is now non-significant and not preserved in the HTML output.
* (bug 47218) Special:BlockList now handles correctly user names with spaces
  when passed as subpage.
* Pager's properly validate which fields are allowed to be sorted on.
* mw.util.tooltipAccessKeyRegexp: The regex now matches "option-" as well.
  Support for Mac "option" was added in 1.16, but the regex was never updated.
* (bug 46768) Usernames of blocking users now display correctly, even if numeric.
* (bug 39590) {{PAGESIZE}} for the current page and self-transclusions now
  show the most up to date result always instead of being a revision behind.
* A bias in wfRandomString() toward digits 1-7 has been corrected. Generated
  strings will now start with digits 0 and 8-f as often as they should.
* (bug 45371) Removed Parser_LinkHooks and CoreLinkFunctions classes.
* (bug 41545) Allow <kbd>, <samp>, and <var> to be nested like allowed in html.
* PLURAL magic word no longer causes a PHP notice when no matching form exists.
* (bug 36641) Patrol page links no longer show on non-existent revisions.
* (bug 35810) Pages not linked from Special:RecentChanges or Special:NewPages
  are patrollable now.
* (bug 30213) JavaScript for search suggestions is now disabled when the API
  is disabled, and AJAX patrolling and watching are now disabled when use of
  the write API is not allowed.
* (bug 48294) API: Fix chunk upload async mode.
* (bug 46749) Broken files tracking category removed from pages if an image
  with that name is uploaded.
* (bug 14176) System messages that are empty were previously incorrectly treated
  as non-existent, causing a fallback to the default. This stopped users from
  overriding system messages to make them blank.
* (bug 48319) action=parse no longer returns an error if passed none of 'oldid',
  'pageid', 'page', 'title', and 'text' (e.g. if only passed 'summary'). A
  warning will instead be issued if 'title' is non-default, unless no props are
  requested.
* Special:Recentchangeslinked will now include upload log entries
* (bug 41281) Fixed ugly output if file size could not be extracted for multi-page media.

=== API changes in 1.22 ===
* (bug 25553) The JSON output formatter now leaves forward slashes unescaped
  to improve human readability of URLs and similar strings. Also, a "utf8"
  option is now provided to use UTF-8 encoding instead of hex escape codes
  for most non-ASCII characters.
* (bug 46626) xmldoublequote parameter was removed. Because of a bug, the
  parameter has had no effect since MediaWiki 1.16, and so its removal is
  unlikely to impact existing clients.
* (bug 47216) action=query&meta=siteinfo&siprop=skins will now indicate which
  skin is the default and which are unusable (e.g. listed in $wgSkipSkins).
* (bug 25325) Added support for wlshow filtering (bots/anon/minor/patrolled)
  to action=feedwatchlist.
* WDDX formatted output will actually be formatted (and normal output will no
  longer be), and will no longer choke on booleans.
* action=opensearch no longer silently ignores the format parameter.
* action=opensearch now supports format=jsonfm.
* list=usercontribs&ucprop=ids will now include the parent revision id.
* BREAKING CHANGE: action=parse no longer returns all langlinks for the page
  with prop=langlinks by default. The new effectivelanglinks parameter will
  request that the LanguageLinks hook be called to determine the effective
  language links.
* BREAKING CHANGE: list=allpages, list=langbacklinks, and prop=langlinks do not
  apply the new LanguageLinks hook, and thus only consider language links
  stored in the database.
* (bug 47219) Allow specifying change type of Wikipedia feed items
* prop=imageinfo now allows setting iiurlheight without setting iiurlwidth
* prop=info now adds the content model and page language of the title.
* New upload log entries will now contain information on the relevant
  image (sha1 and timestamp).
* (bug 49239) action=parse now can parse in preview and section preview modes.
* (bug 49259) action=patrol now accepts revision ids.
* (bug 48129) list=blocks&bkip= now correctly handles IPv6 CIDR ranges and
  honors $wgBlockCIDRLimit. Note any clients passing invalid values to bkip
  will now receive an error, rather than the previous behavior listing all
  user blocks.
* (bug 48201) action=parse&text=foo now assumes wikitext if no title is given,
  rather than using the content model of the page "API".
* action=watch may now return errors.

=== Languages updated in 1.22===

MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated
regularly. Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as
changes to languages because of Bugzilla reports.

* Batak Toba (bbc-latn) added.
* (bug 46751) Made Buryat (Russia) (буряад) (bxr) fallback to Russian.

=== Other changes in 1.22 ===
* BREAKING CHANGE: Implementation of MediaWiki's JS and JSON value encoding
  has changed:
** MediaWiki no longer supports PHP installations in which the native JSON
   extension is missing or disabled.
** XmlJsCode objects can no longer be nested inside objects or arrays.
   (For Xml::encodeJsCall(), this individually applies to each argument.)
** The sets of characters escaped by default, along with the precise escape
   sequences used, have changed (except for the Xml::escapeJsString()
   function, which is now deprecated).
* BREAKING CHANGE: The Services_JSON class has been removed. If necessary,
  be sure to upgrade affected extensions at the same time (e.g. Collection).
* redirect.php was removed. It was unused.
* ClickTracking integration was dropped from the mediaWiki.user.bucket
  JavaScript function. The 'tracked' option is now ignored.
* BREAKING CHANGE: Legacy skins Simple, MySkin, Chick, Standard and Nostalgia
  were all removed. (Nostalgia was moved to an extension.) The SkinLegacy and
  LegacyTemplate classes that supported them were removed as well and are now a
  part of the Nostalgia extension.
* Event namespace used by jquery.makeCollapsible has been changed from
  'mw-collapse' to 'mw-collapsible' for consistency with the module name.
* BREAKING CHANGE: The "ExternalAuth" authentication subsystem was removed, along
  with its associated globals of $wgExternalAuthType, $wgExternalAuthConf,
  $wgAutocreatePolicy and $wgAllowPrefChange. Affected users are encouraged to
  use AuthPlugin for external authentication/authorization needs.
* The Quickbar feature of the legacy skin model and the last remnants of it
  throughout the code base have been removed.
* Externaledit/externaldiff preference was removed. Very few users used this
  feature, and improper configuration can actually prevent a user from editing
* Calling Linker methods using a skin will now output deprecation warnings.
* (bug 46680) "Return to" links are no longer tagged with rel="next".
* BREAKING CHANGE: mw.util.tooltipAccessKeyRegexp: The match group for the
  accesskey character is now $6 instead of $5.
* HipHop compiler (hphpc) support was removed. HipHop VM support (hhvm) was
  added.
* A new Special:Redirect page was added, providing lookup by revision ID,
  user ID, or file name.  The old Special:Filepath page was reimplemented
  to redirect through Special:Redirect.
* Monobook: Removed the old conditional stylesheets for Opera 6, 7 and 9.
* Support for XHTML 1.0 has been removed. MediaWiki now only outputs (X)HTML5.
* wikibits: User-agent related globals have been deprecated. The following
  properties now default to false and emit mw.log.warn: is_gecko, is_chrome_mac,
  is_chrome, webkit_version, is_safari_win, is_safari, webkit_match, is_ff2,
  ff2_bugs, is_ff2_win, is_ff2_x11, opera95_bugs, opera7_bugs, opera6_bugs,
  is_opera_95, is_opera_preseven, is_opera, and ie6_bugs.
* (bug 48276) MediaWiki will now flash a confirmation message upon successfully
  editing a page.
* (bug 40785) mediawiki.legacy.ajax has been marked as deprecated. The following
  properties now emit mw.log.warn when accessed: sajax_debug, sajax_init_object,
  sajax_do_call and wfSupportsAjax.
* BREAKING CHANGE: meta keywords are no longer supported. A <meta name="keywords"
  will no longer be output and OutputPage::addKeyword no longer exists.
* Methods Title::userCanEditCssSubpage and Title::userCanEditJsSubpage,
  deprecated since 1.19, have been removed.
* (bug 50134) Hook functions are no longer required to return a value. When a
  hook function does not return a value (or when it returns an explicit null),
  processing continues. To abort the hook, a hook function must return an
  explicit, boolean false or a string error message. Other falsey values are
  tantamount to a 'return true' in earlier versions of MediaWiki.

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.22 requires PHP 5.3.2 or later.

MySQL is the recommended DBMS. PostgreSQL or SQLite can also be used, but
support for them is somewhat less mature. There is experimental support for
Oracle.

The supported versions are:

* MySQL 5.0.2 or later
* PostgreSQL 8.3 or later
* SQLite 3.3.7 or later
* Oracle 9.0.1 or later

== Upgrading ==

1.22 has several database changes since 1.21, and will not work without schema
updates. Note that due to changes to some very large tables like the revision
table, the schema update may take quite long (minutes on a medium sized site,
many hours on a large site).

If upgrading from before 1.11, and you are using a wiki as a commons
repository, make sure that it is updated as well. Otherwise, errors may arise
due to database schema changes.

If upgrading from before 1.7, you may want to run refreshLinks.php to ensure
new database fields are filled with data.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, you should upgrade to
1.5 first. The upgrade script maintenance/upgrade1_5.php has been removed
with MediaWiki 1.21.

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.

For notes on 1.21.x and older releases, see HISTORY.
