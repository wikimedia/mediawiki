Security reminder: MediaWiki does not require PHP's register_globals. If you
have it on, turn it '''off''' if you can.

== MediaWiki 1.22 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.22 is an alpha-quality branch and is not recommended for use in
production.

=== Configuration changes in 1.22 ===
* $wgRedirectScript was removed. It was unused.
* Removed $wgLocalMessageCacheSerialized, it is now always true.
* When $wgUseVFormUserLogin is true, the redesign of Special:UserLogin is
  activated.
* $wgVectorUseIconWatch is now enabled by default.

=== New features in 1.22 ===
* (bug 44525) mediawiki.jqueryMsg can now parse (whitelisted) HTML elements and attributes.
* (bug 33454) Language::sprintfDate now has a timezone parameter, and supports
  the "eIOPTZ" formatting characters.
* EditWarning: A warning is shown when an editor leaves the edit form without
  saving (enabled by default, users can opt-out via the 'useeditwarning'
  preference). This feature was moved from the Vector extension, and is now part
  of core for all skins. Take care when upgrading that you don't use an older
  version of the Vector extension as this feature may conflict.
* New version of Special:UserLogin form. It is opt-in for now, controlled by
  the $wgUseVFormUserLogin setting or a 'useNew' URL parameter trigger.
* Added 'SpecialSearchResultsPrepend' and 'SpecialSearchResultsAppend' hooks.
* (bug 23343) Implemented ability to apply IP blocks to the contents of X-Forwarded-For headers
  by adding a new configuration variable $wgApplyIpBlocksToXff (disabled by default).
* The new hook 'APIGetPossibleErrors' to modify the list of possible errors was
  added.
* (bug 25592) LogEventsList::showLogExtract() will now ignore various
  Pager-related WebRequest parameters by default, as this is overwhelmingly
  likely to be what was intended by users of the method. If any caller wishes
  to use these parameters, the new param 'useRequestParams' may be set to true.

=== Bug fixes in 1.22 ===
* Disable Special:PasswordReset when $wgEnableEmail. Previously one could still
  navigate to the page by entering the URL directly.
* (bug 47138) Fixed a fatal error when a blocked user tries to automatically
  create an account on login due external authentication in some circumstances.
* (bug 23393) HTML <hN> headings containing line breaks are now handled
  correctly.
* (bug 45803) Whitespace within == Headline == syntax and within <hN> headings
  is now non-significant and not preserved in the HTML output.
* (bug 47218) Special:BlockList now handles correctly user names with spaces
  when passed as subpage.
* Pager's properly validate which fields are allowed to be sorted on.

=== API changes in 1.22 ===
* (bug 46626) xmldoublequote parameter was removed. Because of a bug, the
  parameter has had no effect since MediaWiki 1.16, and so its removal is
  unlikely to impact existing clients.
* (bug 25325) Added support for wlshow filtering (bots/anon/minor/patrolled)
  to action=feedwatchlist.
* WDDX formatted output will actually be formatted (and normal output will no
  longer be), and will no longer choke on booleans.
* action=opensearch no longer silently ignores the format parameter.
* action=opensearch now supports format=jsonfm.

=== Languages updated in 1.22===

MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated
regularly. Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as
changes to languages because of Bugzilla reports.

=== Other changes in 1.22 ===
* redirect.php was removed. It was unused.
* ClickTracking integration was dropped from the mediaWiki.user.bucket
  JavaScript function. The 'tracked' option is now ignored.
* BREAKING CHANGE: Legacy skins Simple, MySkin and Standard were all removed.
  Nostalgia was moved to an extension.
* Event namespace used by jquery.makeCollapsible has been changed from
  'mw-collapse' to 'mw-collapsible' for consistency with the module name.
* BREAKING CHANGE: The "ExternalAuth" authentication subsystem was removed, along
  with its associated globals of $wgExternalAuthType, $wgExternalAuthConf,
  $wgAutocreatePolicy and $wgAllowPrefChange. Affected users are encouraged to
  use AuthPlugin for external authentication/authorization needs.
* The Quickbar feature of the legacy skin model and the last remnants of it
  throughout the code base have been removed.
* Externaledit/externaldiff preference was removed. Very few users used this
  feature, and improper configuration can actually prevent a user from editing
* Calling Linker methods using a skin will now output deprecation warnings.
* (bug 46680) "Return to" links are no longer tagged with rel="next".
* The Special:ActiveUsers special page was removed.

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.22 requires PHP 5.3.2 or later.

MySQL is the recommended DBMS. PostgreSQL or SQLite can also be used, but
support for them is somewhat less mature. There is experimental support for
Oracle.

The supported versions are:

* MySQL 5.0.2 or later
* PostgreSQL 8.3 or later
* SQLite 3.3.7 or later
* Oracle 9.0.1 or later

== Upgrading ==

1.22 has several database changes since 1.21, and will not work without schema
updates. Note that due to changes to some very large tables like the revision
table, the schema update may take quite long (minutes on a medium sized site,
many hours on a large site).

If upgrading from before 1.11, and you are using a wiki as a commons
repository, make sure that it is updated as well. Otherwise, errors may arise
due to database schema changes.

If upgrading from before 1.7, you may want to run refreshLinks.php to ensure
new database fields are filled with data.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, you should upgrade to
1.5 first. The upgrade script maintenance/upgrade1_5.php has been removed
with MediaWiki 1.21.

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.
