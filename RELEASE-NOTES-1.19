setting since version 1.2.0. If you have it on, turn it '''off''' if you can.

== MediaWiki 1.19 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.19 is an alpha-quality branch and is not recommended for use in
production.

=== Configuration changes in 1.19 ===
* Changed LoginAuthenticateAudit hook so that it may be called before a
  valid user is available.  In those cases, an anonymouse user object
  will be supplied.
* Removed SkinTemplateSetupPageCss hook; use BeforePageDisplay instead.
* (bug 27132) movefile right granted by default to registered users.
* Default cookie lifetime ($wgCookieExpiration) is increased to 180 days.
* (bug 31204) Removed old user.user_options.
* $wgMaxImageArea now applies to jpeg files if they are not scaled with
  ImageMagick.
* Introduced $wgQueryPageDefaultLimit (defaults to 50) for the number of
  items to show by default on query pages (special pages such as Whatlinkshere).
* (bug 32470) Increase the length of ug_group.
* (bug 32239) Removed wgEnableTooltipsAndAccesskeys.

=== New features in 1.19 ===
* (bug 19838) Possibility to get all interwiki prefixes if the interwiki
  cache is used.
* $wgDnsBlacklistUrls now accepts an array with url and key as the
  elements to work with DNSBLs that require keys, such as
  Project Honeypot.
* (bug 30022) Add support for custom loadScript sources to ResourceLoader.
* (bug 19052) Unicode space separator characters (Zs) now terminates external
  links and images links.
* (bug 30160) Add public method to mw.loader to get module names from registry.
* (bug 15558) Parameters to special pages included in wikitext can now be passed
  as with templates.

* (bug 29455) Add support for a filter callback function in jQuery byteLimit
  plugin.

  limited type of titles.
* Added a --no-updates flag to importDump.php that skips updating the links
  tables.
* Most presentational html attributes like valign are now converted to inline
  css style rules. These attributes were removed from html5 and so we clean
  them up when $wgHtml5 is enabled. This can be disabled using
  $wgCleanupPresentationalAttributes.
* Magic words (time and number-formatting ones, plus DIRECTIONMARK, but not
  NAMESPACE) now depend on the page content language instead of the site
  language. In theory this sets the right magic words in system messages,
  although they are not used there.

* (bug 30450) Clear page_props table on page deletion.

  to stop it from replace an already existing default sort, and suppress error.
* (bug 18578) Rewrote revision delete related messages to allow better
  localisation.
* (bug 30364) LanguageConverter now depends on the page content language
  instead of the wiki content language.

  in outdated text browsers.

  of generic styles from MonoBook or Vector's css.
* Some deprecated presentational html attributes will now be automatically
  converted to css.
* (bug 31297) Add support for namespaces in Special:RecentChanges subpage filter
  syntax.
* The default user signature now contains a talk link in addition to the user link.
* (bug 25306) Add link of old page title to MediaWiki:Delete_and_move_reason.

* (experimental) $wgRealNameInInterface can be enabled to display a user's
  real name in some parts of the interface instead of a username.
* (bug 30062) Add $wgDBprefix option to cli installer.

  also called when checking for 'read' permission.

* (bug 24037) Add byte length of revision to Special:Contributions.

  require_once() instead require() for included extensions.

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.19 requires PHP 5.2.3. PHP 4 is no longer supported.

MySQL is the recommended DBMS. PostgreSQL or SQLite can also be used, but
support for them is somewhat less mature. There is experimental support for IBM
DB2 and Microsoft SQL Server.

The supported versions are:

* MySQL 4.0 or later
* PostgreSQL 8.3 or later
* SQLite 3
* Oracle 9.0.1 or later

== Upgrading ==

1.19 has several database changes since 1.18, and will not work without schema
updates.

If upgrading from before 1.11, and you are using a wiki as a commons
repository, make sure that it is updated as well. Otherwise, errors may arise
due to database schema changes.

If upgrading from before 1.7, you may want to run refreshLinks.php to ensure
new database fields are filled with data.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, some major database
changes are made, and there is a slightly higher chance that things could
break. Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.

For notes on 1.18.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

A low-traffic announcements-only list is also available:

	http://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-announce

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.

== IRC help ==

There's usually someone online in #mediawiki on irc.freenode.net.
