setting since version 1.2.0. If you have it on, turn it '''off''' if you can.

== MediaWiki 1.19 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.19 is an alpha-quality branch and is not recommended for use in
production.

=== Configuration changes in 1.19 ===
* Removed SkinTemplateSetupPageCss hook; use BeforePageDisplay instead.
* (bug 27132) movefile right granted by default to registered users.
* Default cookie lifetime ($wgCookieExpiration) is increased to 180 days.

=== New features in 1.19 ===
* (bug 30497) Add client-nojs and client-js classes on document element
  to let styles easily hide or show things based on general JS availability
* (bug 19838) Possibility to get all interwiki prefixes if the interwiki
  cache is used.
* $wgDnsBlacklistUrls now accepts an array with url and key as the
  elements to work with DNSBLs that require keys, such as
  Project Honeypot.
* (bug 30022) Add support for custom loadScript sources to ResourceLoader.
* (bug 19052) Unicode space separator characters (Zs) now terminates external
  links and images links.
* (bug 30160) Add public method to mw.loader to get module names from registry.
* (bug 15558) Parameters to special pages included in wikitext can now be passed
  as with templates.
* Installer now issues a warning if mod_security is present.
* (bug 29455) Add support for a filter callback function in jQuery byteLimit
  plugin.
* Extensions can now participate in the extraction of titles from url paths
* Added two new GetLocalURL hooks to better serve extensions working on a
  limited type of titles.
* Added a --no-updates flag to importDump.php that skips updating the links
  tables.
* Most presentational html attributes like valign are now converted to inline
  css style rules. These attributes were removed from html5 and so we clean
  them up when $wgHtml5 is enabled. This can be disabled using
  $wgCleanupPresentationalAttributes.
* Magic words (time and number-formatting ones, plus DIRECTIONMARK, but not
  NAMESPACE) now depend on the page content language instead of the site
  language. In theory this sets the right magic words in system messages,
  although they are not used there.
* (bug 30451) Add page_props to RefreshLinks::deleteLinksFromNonexistent
* (bug 30450) Clear page_props table on page deletion
* Hook added to check for exempt from account creation throttle
* (bug 30344) Add configuration variable for setting custom priorities when
  generating sitemaps
* (bug 16428) Include permalink in printable version
* (bug 96170) Add array support for space-separated list attributes (like
  'class') in the Html helper class.
* (bug 26470) Add checkered background image on hover on files pages.
* (bug 30774) mediawiki.html: Add support for numbers and booleans in the
  attribute values and element contents.

=== Bug fixes in 1.19 ===
* $wgUploadNavigationUrl should be used for file redlinks if
  $wgUploadMissingFileUrl is not set. The first was used for this
  until the second was introduced in 1.17.
* (bug 25355) Parser generates edit section links for special pages.
* (bug 27894) Move 'editondblclick' event listener down from body to
  div#bodyContent.
* (bug 30172) The check for posix_isatty() in maintenance scripts did not detect
  when the function exists but is disabled. Introduced
  Maintenance::posix_isatty().
* (bug 30264) Changed installer-generated LocalSettings.php to use
  require_once() instead require() for included extensions.
* Do not convert text in the user interface language to another script.
* (bug 26283) Previewing user JS/CSS pages didn't load other user JS/CSS pages
* (bug 11374) Improved diff readability for colorblind people.
* (bug 26486) ResourceLoader modules with paths to nonexistent files cause PHP
  warnings/notices to be thrown.
* (bug 30335) Fix for HTMLForms using GET breaking when non-friendly URLs are
  used
* (bug 28649) Avoiding half truncated multi-byte unicode characters when
  truncating log comments.
* Show --batch-size option in help of maintenance scripts that support it
* (bug 4381) Magic quotes cleaning was not comprehensive, key strings were not
  unescaped
* (bug 30684) Fix bad escaping in mw.message for inexistent messages (i.e. <key>)
* (bug 23057) Importers no longer can 'edit' or 'create' a fully-protected page by
  importing a new revision into it

* (bug 29748) Add API search prefix support.
* (bug 29684) Set forgotten parameter types in ApiQueryIWLinks.
* (bug 29685) do not output NULL parentid with list=deletedrevs&drprop=parentid.
* siprop=interwikimap and siprop=languages can use silanguagecode to have
  a best effort language name translation. Use CLDR extension for best result.
* (bug 30230) action=expandtemplates should not silently override invalid title
  inputs.
* (bug 18634) Create API to fetch MediaWiki's language fallback tree structure.
* (bug 26885) Allow show/hide of account blocks, temporary blocks and single IP
  address blocks for list=blocks.
* (bug 30591) Add support to only return keys in ApiAllMessages.

=== Languages updated in 1.19 ===

MediaWiki supports over 330 languages. Many localisations are updated
regularly. Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as
changes to languages because of Bugzilla reports.

* Uighur (Latin) (ug-latn) was incorrectly marked as right-to-left language.
* (bug 30217) Make pt-br a fallback of pt

=== Other changes in 1.19 ===
* jquery.mwPrototypes module was renamed to jquery.mwExtension.
* The maintenance script populateSha1.php was renamed to the more concise
  populateImageSha1.php
* The Client-IP header is no longer checked for when trying to resolve a client's
  real IP address.

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.19 requires PHP 5.2.3. PHP 4 is no longer supported.

MySQL is the recommended DBMS. PostgreSQL or SQLite can also be used, but
support for them is somewhat less mature. There is experimental support for IBM
DB2 and Microsoft SQL Server.

The supported versions are:

* MySQL 4.0 or later
* PostgreSQL 8.3 or later
* SQLite 3
* Oracle 9.0.1 or later

== Upgrading ==

1.19 has several database changes since 1.18, and will not work without schema
updates.

If upgrading from before 1.11, and you are using a wiki as a commons
repository, make sure that it is updated as well. Otherwise, errors may arise
due to database schema changes.

If upgrading from before 1.7, you may want to run refreshLinks.php to ensure
new database fields are filled with data.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, some major database
changes are made, and there is a slightly higher chance that things could
break. Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.

For notes on 1.15.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.
