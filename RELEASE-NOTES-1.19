Security reminder: MediaWiki does not require PHP's register_globals
setting since version 1.2.0. If you have it on, turn it '''off''' if you can.

== MediaWiki 1.19 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.19 is an alpha-quality branch and is not recommended for use in
production.

=== Configuration changes in 1.19 ===
* Removed SkinTemplateSetupPageCss hook; use BeforePageDisplay instead.

=== New features in 1.19 ===
* (bug 19838) Possibility to get all interwiki prefixes if the interwiki
  cache is used.
* $wgDnsBlacklistUrls now accepts an array with url and key as the
  elements to work with DNSBLs that require keys, such as
  Project Honeypot.
* (bug 30022) Add support for custom loadScript sources to ResourceLoader.
* (bug 19052) Unicode space separator characters (Zs) now terminates external
  links and images links.

=== Bug fixes in 1.19 ===
* $wgUploadNavigationUrl should be used for file redlinks if
  $wgUploadMissingFileUrl is not set. The first was used for this
  until the second was introduced in 1.17.
* (bug 25355) Parser generates edit section links for special pages
* (bug 13766) Change table of content syntax to be semantically correct

=== API changes in 1.19 ===
* (bug 19838) siprop=interwikimap can now use the interwiki cache.
* (bug 29748) Add API search prefix support.
* (bug 29684) Set forgotten parameter types in ApiQueryIWLinks.
* (bug 29685) do not output NULL parentid with list=deletedrevs&drprop=parentid.
* siprop=interwikimap and siprop=languages can use silanguagecode to have
  a best effort language name translation. Use CLDR extension for best result.

=== Languages updated in 1.19 ===

MediaWiki supports over 330 languages. Many localisations are updated
regularly. Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as
changes to languages because of Bugzilla reports.

* Remove RTL variable from Uighur (Latin) localisation.

=== Other changes in 1.19 ===

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.19 requires PHP 5.2.3. PHP 4 is no longer supported.

MySQL is the recommended DBMS. PostgreSQL or SQLite can also be used, but
support for them is somewhat less mature. There is experimental support for IBM
DB2 and Microsoft SQL Server.

The supported versions are:

* MySQL 4.0 or later
* PostgreSQL 8.3 or later
* SQLite 3
* Oracle 9.0.1 or later

== Upgrading ==

1.19 has several database changes since 1.18, and will not work without schema
updates.

If upgrading from before 1.11, and you are using a wiki as a commons
repository, make sure that it is updated as well. Otherwise, errors may arise
due to database schema changes.

If upgrading from before 1.7, you may want to run refreshLinks.php to ensure
new database fields are filled with data.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, some major database
changes are made, and there is a slightly higher chance that things could
break. Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.

For notes on 1.15.x and older releases, see HISTORY.
