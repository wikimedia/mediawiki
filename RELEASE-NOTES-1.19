  amount of user/site scripts that are lacking dependency information. In the short to
  medium term these user/site scripts should be fixed by adding the used modules to the
  dependencies in the module registry and/or wrapping them in a callback to mw.loader.using.

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.19 requires PHP 5.2.3. PHP 4 is no longer supported.

MySQL is the recommended DBMS. PostgreSQL or SQLite can also be used, but
support for them is somewhat less mature. There is experimental support for IBM
DB2 and Oracle.

The supported versions are:

* MySQL 5.0.2 or later
* PostgreSQL 8.3 or later
* SQLite 3.3.7 or later
* Oracle 9.0.1 or later

== Upgrading ==

1.19 has several database changes since 1.18, and will not work without schema
updates.

As of 1.19 several JavaScript interfaces that were deprecated or superseeded in
MediaWiki 1.17, MediaWiki 1.16 or even earlier have been removed. They are
listed at the top of the "Other changes" list as a "BREAKING CHANGE".

If upgrading from before 1.11, and you are using a wiki as a commons
repository, make sure that it is updated as well. Otherwise, errors may arise
due to database schema changes.

If upgrading from before 1.7, you may want to run refreshLinks.php to ensure
new database fields are filled with data.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, some major database
changes are made, and there is a slightly higher chance that things could
break. Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.

For notes on 1.18.x and older releases, see HISTORY.
