== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.19 requires PHP 5.2.3. PHP 4 is no longer supported.

MySQL is the recommended DBMS. PostgreSQL or SQLite can also be used, but
support for them is somewhat less mature. There is experimental support for IBM
DB2 and Microsoft SQL Server.

The supported versions are:

* MySQL 4.0 or later
* PostgreSQL 8.3 or later
* SQLite 3
* Oracle 9.0.1 or later

== Upgrading ==

1.19 has several database changes since 1.17, and will not work without schema
updates.

If upgrading from before 1.11, and you are using a wiki as a commons
repository, make sure that it is updated as well. Otherwise, errors may arise
due to database schema changes.

If upgrading from before 1.7, you may want to run refreshLinks.php to ensure
new database fields are filled with data.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, some major database
changes are made, and there is a slightly higher chance that things could
break. Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.

For notes on 1.15.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

== Mailing list ==

A mailing list is available for MediaWiki user support and discussion:

A low-traffic announcements-only list is also available:

	http://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-announce

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.

== IRC help ==

There's usually someone online in #mediawiki on irc.freenode.net.
