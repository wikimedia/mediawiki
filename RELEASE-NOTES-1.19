== MediaWiki 1.19 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.19 is an alpha-quality branch and is not recommended for use in
production.

=== Configuration changes in 1.19 ===
* Removed SkinTemplateSetupPageCss hook; use BeforePageDisplay instead.
* (bug 27132) movefile right granted by default to registered users.
* Default cookie lifetime ($wgCookieExpiration) is increased to 180 days.
* (bug 31204) Removed old user.user_options

=== New features in 1.19 ===
* (bug 30497) Add client-nojs and client-js classes on document element
  to let styles easily hide or show things based on general JS availability
* (bug 19838) Possibility to get all interwiki prefixes if the interwiki
  cache is used.
* $wgDnsBlacklistUrls now accepts an array with url and key as the
  elements to work with DNSBLs that require keys, such as
  Project Honeypot.
* (bug 30022) Add support for custom loadScript sources to ResourceLoader.
* (bug 19052) Unicode space separator characters (Zs) now terminates external
  links and images links.
* (bug 30160) Add public method to mw.loader to get module names from registry.
* (bug 15558) Parameters to special pages included in wikitext can now be passed
  as with templates.
* Installer now issues a warning if mod_security is present.
* (bug 29455) Add support for a filter callback function in jQuery byteLimit
  plugin.
* Extensions can now participate in the extraction of titles from url paths
* Added two new GetLocalURL hooks to better serve extensions working on a
  limited type of titles.
* Added a --no-updates flag to importDump.php that skips updating the links
  tables.
* Most presentational html attributes like valign are now converted to inline
  css style rules. These attributes were removed from html5 and so we clean
  them up when $wgHtml5 is enabled. This can be disabled using
  $wgCleanupPresentationalAttributes.
* Magic words (time and number-formatting ones, plus DIRECTIONMARK, but not
  NAMESPACE) now depend on the page content language instead of the site
  language. In theory this sets the right magic words in system messages,
  although they are not used there.

* (bug 30450) Clear page_props table on page deletion
* Hook added to check for exempt from account creation throttle

  generating sitemaps

  'class') in the Html helper class.
* (bug 26470) Add checkered background image on hover on files pages.
* (bug 30774) mediawiki.html: Add support for numbers and booleans in the
  attribute values and element contents.
* Conversion script between Tifinagh and Latin for the Tachelhit language
* (bug 16755) Add options 'noreplace' and 'noerror' to {{DEFAULTSORT:...}}
  to stop it from replace an already existing default sort, and suppress error.
* (bug 18578) Rewrote revision delete related messages to allow better
  localisation
* (bug 30364) LanguageConverter now depends on the page content language
  instead of the wiki content language
* Jump links will now be usable in css-capable browsers instead of only
  in outdated text browsers.
* New common*.css files usable by skins instead of having to copy piles
  of generic styles from MonoBook or Vector's css.
* Some deprecated presentational html attributes will now be automatically converted to css.
* (bug 31233) New OutputPage::addJsConfigVars() method to make the output page specific
  mw.config map extendable.

=== Bug fixes in 1.19 ===
* $wgUploadNavigationUrl should be used for file redlinks if
  $wgUploadMissingFileUrl is not set. The first was used for this
  until the second was introduced in 1.17.
* (bug 25355) Parser generates edit section links for special pages.
* (bug 27894) Move 'editondblclick' event listener down from body to
  div#bodyContent.
* (bug 30172) The check for posix_isatty() in maintenance scripts did not detect
  when the function exists but is disabled. Introduced
  Maintenance::posix_isatty().

  require_once() instead require() for included extensions.

  warnings/notices to be thrown.

  used
* (bug 28649) Avoiding half truncated multi-byte unicode characters when
  truncating log comments.
* Show --batch-size option in help of maintenance scripts that support it
* (bug 4381) Magic quotes cleaning was not comprehensive, key strings were not
  unescaped
* (bug 30684) Fix bad escaping in mw.message for inexistent messages (i.e. <key>)
* (bug 23057) Importers no longer can 'edit' or 'create' a fully-protected page by
  importing a new revision into it
* Allowing moving the associated talk pages of subpages even if the base page
  has no subpage.
* (bug 30907) Special:Unusedcategories should sort ascendingly.
* (bug 18424) Special:Prefixindex and Special:Allpages paging links are
  really small, and somewhat inconsistent with each other.
* Per page edit-notices now work in namespaces without subpages enabled.
* (bug 30245) Use the correct way to construct a log page title
* (bug 31081) $wgEnotifUseJobQ causes many unnecessary jobs to be queued

=== Languages updated in 1.19 ===

MediaWiki supports over 330 languages. Many localisations are updated
regularly. Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as
changes to languages because of Bugzilla reports.

* Uighur (Latin) (ug-latn) was incorrectly marked as right-to-left language.
* (bug 30217) Make pt-br a fallback of pt
* (bug 31193) Set fallback language of Assamese from Bengali to English

=== Other changes in 1.19 ===
* jquery.mwPrototypes module was renamed to jquery.mwExtension.
* The maintenance script populateSha1.php was renamed to the more concise
  populateImageSha1.php
* The Client-IP header is no longer checked for when trying to resolve a client's
  real IP address.

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.19 requires PHP 5.2.3. PHP 4 is no longer supported.

MySQL is the recommended DBMS. PostgreSQL or SQLite can also be used, but
support for them is somewhat less mature. There is experimental support for IBM
DB2 and Microsoft SQL Server.

The supported versions are:

* MySQL 4.0 or later
* PostgreSQL 8.3 or later
* SQLite 3
* Oracle 9.0.1 or later

== Upgrading ==

1.19 has several database changes since 1.18, and will not work without schema
updates.

If upgrading from before 1.11, and you are using a wiki as a commons
repository, make sure that it is updated as well. Otherwise, errors may arise
due to database schema changes.

If upgrading from before 1.7, you may want to run refreshLinks.php to ensure
new database fields are filled with data.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, some major database
changes are made, and there is a slightly higher chance that things could
break. Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.

For notes on 1.15.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

== Online documentation ==

Documentation for both end-users and site administrators is available on
MediaWiki.org, and is covered under the GNU Free Documentation License (except

== Mailing list ==

A mailing list is available for MediaWiki user support and discussion:

	http://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-l

A low-traffic announcements-only list is also available:

	http://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-announce

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.

== IRC help ==

There's usually someone online in #mediawiki on irc.freenode.net.
