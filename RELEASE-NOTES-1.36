  configuration variable sets the maximum number of revisions of a page that
  will be checked against every new edit. Set this to 0 to disable the feature
  entirely.

=== Breaking changes in 1.36 ===
* (T176526) EditPage::getContextTitle() will now throw an exception if a context
  title was not set using setContextTitle(). Previously, this mis-use would only
  cause a deprecation warning to be emitted.
* Multiple methods that fell back to the $wgUser global variable were
  individually hard deprecated previously. The following have now been removed:
  - ApiTestCase::doLogin
  - Article::doDeleteArticle
  - Article::doDeleteArticleReal
  - Article::getComment
  - Article::getCreator
  - Article::getUser
  - Article::getUserText
  - Article::insertProtectNullRevision
  - File::delete
  - File::recordUpload
  - ForeignDBFile::delete
  - ForeignDBFile::recordUpload
  - LocalFile::delete
  - LocalFile::deleteOld
  - LocalFile::recordUpload
  - PageArchive::undelete
  - RecentChange::markPatrolled
  - Title::getUserPermissionsErrors
  - Title::quickUserCan
  - Title::userCan
  - WebRequest::getLimitOffset
  - WikiPage::doDeleteArticle
  - WikiPage::insertProtectNullRevision
  - All methods of the old SpecialPageFactory; the entire class was removed
* Multiple methods previously had optional User parameters, with fallbacks
  to the $wgUser global variable. Not passing a User to those methods was
  previously hard deprecated, and support for not passing a User has now
  been removed:
   - FileDeleteForm::__construct
   - FileDeleteForm::doDelete
   - LocalFileDeleteBatch::__construct
   - LogEventsList::getExcludeClause (only needed for the 'user' audience)
   - LogEventsList::userCan
   - LogEventsList::userCanBitfield
   - LogEventsList::userCanViewLogType
   - LogPage::addEntry (also accepts user id instead)
   - PatrolLog::record
   - Title::getNotificationTimestamp (though the entire method is deprecated)
   - WikiPage::getComment (only needed for the FOR_THIS_USER audience)
   - WikiPage::getCreator (only needed for the FOR_THIS_USER audience)
   - WikiPage::getUser (only needed for the FOR_THIS_USER audience)
   - WikiPage::getUserText (only needed for the FOR_THIS_USER audience)
* The following hooks have been removed:
   - APIQueryInfoTokens
   - APIQueryRecentChangesTokens
   - APIQueryRevisionsTokens
   - APIQueryUsersTokens
   - ApiTokensGetTokenTypes
* LogEventsList::typeAction previously accepted an optional right parameter,
  and checked if the context user ($wgUser) had that right. Passing a right
  was hard deprecated in 1.35, and support for passing a right has now been
  removed.
* WikiPage::doDeleteArticleReal previously accepted an optional user as its
  fifth parameter, and fell back to $wgUser if not user was provided. The
  signature changed to have the user as the second parameter, and the old
  signature was hard deprecated in 1.35. Support for the old signature has
  now been removed.
* User::addNewUserLogEntry, deprecated since 1.27, was removed.
* The global function `wfWaitForSlaves`, deprecated in 1.27 and hard-deprecated
  in 1.35, has been removed. Use LBFactory::waitForReplication() instead.
* The global variable $wgMemc, deprecated since 1.35, has been removed.
  Usage should generally be migrated to WANObjectCache, or if you really need
  the internal object, use ObjectCache::getLocalClusterInstance instead.
* CategoryFinder, which was deprecated in 1.31 and hard-deprecated in 1.35,
  has been removed.
* Sanitizer::escapeId(), deprecated in 1.30, has been removed.
* Parser::setFunctionTagHook(), deprecated in 1.35, has been removed.
* The ParserBeforeTidy hook, deprecated in 1.35, has been removed.
* All methods of MWTidy except for MW::tidy() have been removed.  These
  were either @internal or deprecated in 1.35.
* The support for IE8 has been dropped.
* Less mixin `.background-image-svg-quick()` from mediawiki.mixins.less,
  deprecated since 1.35, has been removed.
* The ResourceLoader module `mediawiki.legacy.oldshared` and its file
  'oldshared.css', deprecated since 1.35 has been removed (T248357).
* The LinkBegin and LinkEnd hooks, deprecated in 1.28, have been removed. You
  can instead use the HtmlPageLinkRendererBegin and HtmlPageLinkRendererEnd
  hooks, respectively.
* Skin::getDynamicStylesheetQuery(), deprecated in 1.32, has been removed. You
  should use action=raw&ctype=text/css directly.
* Skin::makeI18nUrl(), deprecated in 1.35, has been removed.
* The following User methods, deprecated and moved to BlockManager in 1.34,
  were removed: isDnsBlacklisted, inDnsBlacklist, isLocallyBlockedProxy,
  trackBlockWithCookie.
* Support for v1 of the parser tests file format has been removed; it was
  deprecated in 1.35. (T174199)
* SpecialUnblockUser::processUIUnblock() has a different return
  value (previously, array of messages or a boolean value, now,
  a Status object). This function was also marked as @internal and is no
  longer safe to call it publicly.
* mw.Title.getDotExtension() from the 'mediawiki.Title' module was removed
  without deprecation. You should use mw.Title.getExtension() and prepend
  the dot if need be.
* Removed HookContainer::getOriginalHooksForTest() without deprecation.
  This method was introduced in 1.35 for internal use, and appears unused
  outside of MediaWiki core.
* ParserCache::__construct() now requires three parameters.
* Message->getFormat(), deprecated in 1.29, has been removed.
* …

=== Deprecations in 1.36 ===
* LocalFile::recordUpload2, soft deprecated in 1.35, now emits deprecation
  warnings. Use ::recordUpload3 instead.
* The User class, which was marked as @newable in 1.35, is no longer newable,
  meaning that it is no longer safe to manually call the constructor via
  `new User`. Instead, use the UserFactory service.
* Use of the `preprocessor=Preprocessor_DOM` option in parser test files has
  been deprecated.  Preprocessor_DOM was removed in 1.35.
* ParserOptions::setTidy() has been deprecated.  It has had no effect since
  1.35.
* Sanitizer::escapeIdReferenceList() has been deprecated; it will eventually
  be made private to the class, as it appears to have no uses outside the
  Sanitizer class.
* Sanitizer::hackDocType() is deprecated; it will eventually be made private.
* Skin::getIndicatorsHTML() is deprecated. The functionality can be retained
  by reimplementing the method using the raw indicators data from
  OutputPage::getIndicators.
* Skin::makeVariablesScript() has been deprecated. Use
  ResourceLoader::makeInlineScript() instead.
* The PageProps class was converted to a service. PageProps::overrideInstance
  was deprecated, and MediaWikiServices::redefineService should be used
  instead.
* Title::nameOf() is deprecated; use Title::newFromID()->getPrefixedDBkey()
  instead.
* DatabaseBlock::insert, DatabaseBlock::update, DatabaseBlock::purgeExpired and
  DatabaseBlock::delete are deprecated. Use DatabaseBlockStore::insertBlock,
  DatabaseBlockStore::updateBlock, DatabaseBlockStore::purgeExpiredBlocks and
  DatabaseBlockStore::deleteBlock instead.
* SpecialBlock::getTargetAndType is deprecated. Call AbstractBlock::parseTarget
  directly instead.
* SpecialUnblock::processUnblock was deprecated - use UnblockUserFactory
  service instead.
* Deprecated MediaWikiIntegrationtestCase::removeTemporaryHook() in favor of
  MediaWikiIntegrationtestCase::clearHook().
* Skin::getSearchLink(), also exposed as 'searchaction' option in SkinTemplate,
  has been deprecated. Use Title or SpecialPage methods directly.
* Skin::getAllowedSkins and ::getSkinNames have been deprecated. Use their
  respective equivalents in SkinFactory instead.
* The RollbackComplete hook has been deprecated, use the PageSaveComplete hook
  instead.
* Skin::makeUrl() has been deprecated. Title methods should be used instead.
* Skin::privacyLink(), Skin::disclaimerLink() and Skin::aboutLink() have been
  deprecated. Please use Skin::footerLink() instead.
* Skin::getLogo() has been deprecated. Use ResourceLoaderSkinModule instead.
* Skin::mainPageLink() has been deprecated. Use LinkRenderer service instead.
* BaseTemplate::getToolbox() method has been hard deprecated. The toolbox data
  is now available in a sidebar data array which you can get from any class
  that's extending QuickTemplate class.
* Constructing a DefaultPreferencesFactory, LinkHolderArray or PasswordReset
  without a $hookContainer parameter is deprecated.
* Autopromote class, soft deprecated since 1.35, now emits deprecation warnings.
  Use UserGroupManager instead.

  BlockPermissionChecker::checkEmailPermissions instead.
* SpecialBlock::checkUnblockSelf has been deprecated. Please use
  BlockPermissionChecker::checkBlockPermissions instead.
* SpecialBlock::parseExpiryInput was deprecated - use
  BlockUser::parseExpiryInput instead.
* …

=== Other changes in 1.36 ===
* The 'tidy' key in ParserOptions (used in the parser cache) has been removed.
  It has had no effect since 1.35.
* A future release of MediaWiki will make {{=}} a built-in parser function,
  for use when automatically escaping the `=` character in template arguments.
  A tracking category and parser warning have been added to this release when
  {{=}} is used and it expands to something other than `=`.
* The implementation of TestFileReader::read has been changed to use
  Parsoid's parser test file parser.  This should be compatible with
  existing code, but it only supports version 2 of the test file
  specification and may be more strict when parsing invalid input,
  including duplicate tests.
* The SkinLessImportPaths attribute was added, allowing skins to add a
  directory to the import path for LESS stylesheets. Skins can use this
  to provide a custom version of mediawiki.skin.variables.less, setting
  skin-specific values for certain LESS variables.
* …
