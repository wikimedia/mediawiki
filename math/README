== About texvc ==

texvc takes LaTeX-compatible equations and produces formatted output in
HTML, MathML, and (via LaTeX/dvips/ImageMagick) rasterized PNG images.
Input data is parsed and scrutinized for safety, and the output includes
an estimate of whether the code is simple enough that HTML rendering will
look acceptable.

The program was written by Tomasz Wegrzanowski for use with MediaWiki;
it's included as part of the MediaWiki package (http://wikipedia.sf.net)
and is under the GPL license.

== Setup ==

=== Requirements ===

OCaml 3.06 or later is required to compile texvc; this can be acquired
from http://caml.inria.fr/ if your system doesn't have it available.

The makefile requires GNU make.

Rasterization is done via LaTeX, dvips, and ImageMagick. These need
to be installed and in the PATH: latex, dvips, convert

To work properly with rendering non-ASCII Unicode characters, a
supplemental TeX package is needed (cjk-latex in Debian)

=== Installation ===

Run 'make' (or 'gmake' if GNU make is not your default make). This should
produce the texvc executable.

If you're using MediaWiki's install.php and have enabled $wgUseTeX in your
LocalSettings.php, the installer will try to copy texvc into place, in the
'math' subdirectory under where wiki.phtml is installed.


== Usage ==

Normally texvc is called from MediaWiki's Math.php modules and everything
Just Works. It can be run manually for testing or for use in another app.

=== Command-line parameters ===

    texvc <temp directory> <output directory> <TeX code> <encoding>

Be sure to properly quote the TeX code!

Example:

    texvc /home/wiki/tmp /home/wiki/math "y=x+2" iso-8859-1

=== Output format ===

Status codes and HTML/MathML transformations are returned on stdout.
A rasterized PNG file will be written to the output directory, named
for the MD5 hash code.

texvc output format is like this:
    +%5		ok, but not html or mathml
    c%5%h	ok, conservative html, no mathml
    m%5%h	ok, moderate html, no mathml
    l%5%h	ok, liberal html, no mathml
    C%5%h\0%m	ok, conservative html, with mathml
    M%5%h\0%m	ok, moderate html, with mathml
    L%5%h\0%m	ok, liberal html, with mathml
    X%5%m	ok, no html, with mathml
    S		syntax error
    E		lexing error
    F%s		unknown function %s
    -		other error

 \0 - null character
 %5 - md5, 32 hex characters
 %h - html code, without \0 characters
 %m - mathml code, without \0 characters


== Troubleshooting ==

Unforunately, many error conditions with rasterization are not well reported.
texvc will return as though everything is successful, and the only obvious
sign of problems for the user is a big X on a wiki page where an equation
should be.

Try running texvc from the command line to ensure that the software it relies
upon is all set up.

Ensure that the temporary and math directories exist and can be written to by
the user account the web server runs under; if you don't control the server,
you may have to make them world-writable.
