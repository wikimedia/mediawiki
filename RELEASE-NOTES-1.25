=== Configuration changes in 1.25 ===
* $wgSkipSkins is no longer necessary now that skin autodiscovery is gone and
  has been deprecated. It will be removed together with $wgSkipSkin (already
  deprecated in 1.23) in the future.

=== Other changes in 1.25 ===
* The skin autodiscovery mechanism, deprecated in MediaWiki 1.23, has been
  removed. See https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Skin_autodiscovery for
  migration guide for creators and users of custom skins that relied on it.
