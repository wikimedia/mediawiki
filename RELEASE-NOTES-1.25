Security reminder: If you have PHP's register_globals option set, you must
turn it off. MediaWiki will not work with it enabled.

== MediaWiki 1.25 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.25 is an alpha-quality branch and is not recommended for use in
production.

=== Configuration changes in 1.25 ===
* $wgPageShowWatchingUsers was removed.
* $wgLocalVirtualHosts has been added to replace $wgConf->localVHosts.
* $wgAntiLockFlags was removed.
* Edit tokens returned from User::getEditToken may change on every call. Token
  validity must be checked by passing the user-supplied token to
  User::matchEditToken rather than by testing for equality with a
  newly-generated token.
* (bug 72951) The UserGetLanguageObject hook may be passed any IContextSource
  for its $context parameter. Formerly it was documented as receiving a
  RequestContext specifically.
* Profiling was restructured and $wgProfiler now requires an 'output' parameter.
  See StartProfiler.sample for details.
* $wgMangleFlashPolicy was added to make MediaWiki's mangling of anything that
  might be a flash policy directive configurable.

=== New features in 1.25 ===
* (bug 62861) Updated plural rules to CLDR 26. Includes incompatible changes
  for plural forms in Russian, Prussian, Tagalog, Manx and several languages
  that fall back to Russian.
* (bug 58139) ResourceLoaderFileModule now supports language fallback
  for 'languageScripts'.
* Added a new hook, "ContentAlterParserOutput", to allow extensions to modify the
  parser output for a content object before links update.
* (bug 35785) Enhanced recent changes and extended watchlist are now default.
  Documentation: https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Enhanced_recent_changes
  and https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:$wgDefaultUserOptions.
* (bug 67341) SVG images will no longer be base64-encoded when being embedded
  in CSS. This results in slight size increase before gzip compression (due to
  percent-encoding), but up to 20% decrease after it.
* Upgrade jStorage to v0.4.12.
* MediaWiki now natively supports page status indicators: icons (or short text
  snippets) usually displayed in the top-right corner of the page. They have
  been in use on Wikipedia for a long time, implemented using templates and CSS
  absolute positioning.
  - Basic wikitext syntax: <indicator name="foo">[[File:Foo.svg|20px]]</indicator>
  - Usage instructions: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Page_status_indicators
  - Adjusting custom skins to support indicators:
    https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Skinning#Page_status_indicators
* Edit tokens may now be time-limited: passing a maximum age to
  User::matchEditToken will reject any older tokens.
* The debug logging internals have been overhauled, and are now using the
  PSR-3 interfaces.

=== Bug fixes in 1.25 ===
* (bug 71003) No additional code will be generated to try to load CSS-embedded
  SVG images in Internet Explorer 6 and 7, as they don't support them anyway.
* (bug 67021) On Special:BookSources, corrected validation of ISBNs (both
  10- and 13-digit forms) containing "X".
* Page moving was refactored into a MovePage class. As part of that:
** The AbortMove hook was removed.
** MovePageIsValidMove is for extensions to specify whether a page
   cannot be moved for technical reasons, and should not be overriden.
** MovePageCheckPermissions is for checking whether the given user is
   allowed to make the move.
** Title::moveNoAuth() was deprecated. Use the MovePage class instead.
** Title::moveTo() was deprecated. Use the MovePage class instead.
** Title::isValidMoveOperation() broken down into MovePage::isValidMove()
   and MovePage::checkPermissions().

=== Action API changes in 1.25 ===
* (bug 65403) XML tag highlighting is now only performed for formats
  "xmlfm" and "wddxfm".
* action=paraminfo supports generalized submodules (modules=query+value),
  querymodules and formatmodules are deprecated
* action=paraminfo no longer outputs descriptions and other help text by
  default. If needed, it may be requested using the new 'helpformat' parameter.
* action=help has been completely rewritten, and outputs help in HTML
  rather than plain text.
* Hitting api.php without specifying an action now displays only the help for
  the main module, with links to submodule help.
* API help is no longer displayed on errors.
* 'uselang' is now a recognized API parameter; "uselang=user" may be used to
  explicitly select the language from the current user's preferences, and
  "uselang=content" may be used to select the wiki's content language.
* Default output format for the API is now jsonfm.
* Simplified continuation will return a "batchcomplete" property in the result
  when a batch of pages is complete.
* Pretty-printed HTML output now has nicer formatting and (if available)
  better syntax highlighting.
* Deprecated list=deletedrevs in favor of newly-added prop=deletedrevisions and
  list=alldeletedrevisions.
* prop=revisions will gracefully continue when given too many revids or titles,
  rather than just ignoring the extras.
* prop=revisions will no longer die if rvcontentformat doesn't match a
  revision's content model; it will instead warn and omit the content.
* If the user has the 'deletedhistory' right, action=query's revids parameter
  will now recognize deleted revids.
* prop=revisions may be used as a generator, generating revids.

=== Action API internal changes in 1.25 ===
* ApiHelp has been rewritten to support i18n and paginated HTML output.
  Most existing modules should continue working without changes, but should do
  the following:
  * Add an i18n message "apihelp-{$moduleName}-description" to replace getDescription().
  * Add i18n messages "apihelp-{$moduleName}-param-{$param}" for each parameter
    to replace getParamDescription(). If necessary, the settings array returned
    by getParams() can use the new ApiBase::PARAM_HELP_MSG key to override the
    message.
  * Implement getExamplesMessages() to replace getExamples().
* Modules with submodules (like action=query) must have their submodules
  override ApiBase::getParent() to return the correct parent object.
* The 'APIGetDescription' and 'APIGetParamDescription' hooks are deprecated,
  and will have no effect for modules using i18n messages. Use
  'APIGetDescriptionMessages' and 'APIGetParamDescriptionMessages' instead.
* Api formatters will no longer be asked to display the help screen on errors.
* ApiMain::getCredits() was removed. The credits are available in the
  'api-credits' i18n message.
* ApiFormatBase has been changed to support i18n and syntax highlighting via
  extensions with the new 'ApiFormatHighlight' hook. Core syntax highlighting
  has been removed.
* ApiFormatBase now always buffers. Output is done when
  ApiFormatBase::closePrinter is called.
* Much of the logic in ApiQueryRevisions has been split into ApiQueryRevisionsBase.
* The 'revids' parameter supplied by ApiPageSet will now count deleted
  revisions as "good" if the user has the 'deletedhistory' right. New methods
  ApiPageSet::getLiveRevisionIDs() and ApiPageSet::getDeletedRevisionIDs() are
  provided to access just the live or just the deleted revids.
* The following methods have been deprecated and may be removed in a future
  release:
  * ApiBase::getDescription
  * ApiBase::getParamDescription
  * ApiBase::getExamples
  * ApiBase::makeHelpMsg
  * ApiBase::makeHelpArrayToString
  * ApiBase::makeHelpMsgParameters
  * ApiFormatBase::setUnescapeAmps
  * ApiFormatBase::getWantsHelp
  * ApiFormatBase::setHelp
  * ApiFormatBase::formatHTML
  * ApiFormatBase::setBufferResult
  * ApiFormatBase::getDescription
  * ApiMain::setHelp
  * ApiMain::reallyMakeHelpMsg
  * ApiMain::makeHelpMsgHeader
  * ApiQueryImageInfo::getPropertyDescriptions
* The following classes have been deprecated and may be removed in a future
  release:
  * ApiQueryDeletedrevs

=== Languages updated in 1.25 ===

MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated
regularly. Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as
changes to languages because of Bugzilla reports.

* (bug 64440) Kazakh (kk) wikis should no longer forcefully reset the user's
  interface language to kk where unexpected.

=== Other changes in 1.25 ===
* The skin autodiscovery mechanism, deprecated in MediaWiki 1.23, has been
  removed. See https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Skin_autodiscovery for
  migration guide for creators and users of custom skins that relied on it.
* Javascript variable 'wgFileCanRotate' now only available on Special:Upload.
* (bug 56257) Set site logo from mediawiki.skinning.interface module instead of
  inline styles in the HTML.
* Removed ApiQueryUsers::getAutoGroups(). (deprecated since 1.20)
* Removed XmlDumpWriter::schemaVersion(). (deprecated since 1.20)
* Removed LogEventsList::getDisplayTitle(). (deprecated since 1.20)
* Removed Preferences::trySetUserEmail(). (deprecated since 1.20)
* Removed mw.user.name() and mw.user.anonymous() methods. (deprecated since 1.20)
* Removed 'ok' and 'err' parameters in the mediawiki.api modules. (deprecated
  since 1.20)
* Removed 'async' parameter from the  mw.Api#getCategories() method. (deprecated
  since 1.20)
* Removed 'jquery.json' module. (deprecated since 1.24)
  Use the 'json' module and global JSON object instead.
* Deprecated OutputPage::readOnlyPage() and OutputPage::rateLimited().
  Also, the former will now throw an MWException if called with one or more
  arguments.
* Removed hitcounters and associated code.
* The "temp" zone of the upload respository is now considered private. If it
  already exists (such as under the images/ directory), please make sure that
  the directory is not web readable (e.g. via a .htaccess file).
* BREAKING CHANGE: In the XML dump format used by Special:Export and
  dumpBackup.php, the <model> and <format> tags now apprear before the <text>
  tag, instead of after the <text> and <sha1> tags.
  The new schema version is 0.10, the new schema URI is
  <https://www.mediawiki.org/xml/export-0.10.xsd>.
* MWFunction::call() and MWFunction::callArray() were removed, having being
  deprecated in 1.22.
* Deprecated the getInternalLinkAttributes, getInternalLinkAttributesObj,
  and getInternalLinkAttributes methods in Linker, and removed
  getExternalLinkAttributes method, which was deprecated in MediaWiki 1.18.

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.25 requires PHP 5.3.3 or later. There is experimental support for
HHVM 3.3.0.

MySQL is the recommended DBMS. PostgreSQL or SQLite can also be used, but
support for them is somewhat less mature. There is experimental support for
Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server.

The supported versions are:

* MySQL 5.0.2 or later
* PostgreSQL 8.3 or later
* SQLite 3.3.7 or later
* Oracle 9.0.1 or later
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 (9.00.1399)

== Upgrading ==

1.25 has several database changes since 1.24, and will not work without schema
updates. Note that due to changes to some very large tables like the revision
table, the schema update may take quite long (minutes on a medium sized site,
many hours on a large site).

If upgrading from before 1.11, and you are using a wiki as a commons
repository, make sure that it is updated as well. Otherwise, errors may arise
due to database schema changes.

If upgrading from before 1.7, you may want to run refreshLinks.php to ensure
new database fields are filled with data.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, you should upgrade to
1.5 first. The upgrade script maintenance/upgrade1_5.php has been removed
with MediaWiki 1.21.

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.

For notes on 1.23.x and older releases, see HISTORY.
