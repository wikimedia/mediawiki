== Upgrading notes for 1.41 ==
Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed per-version upgrade instructions from the
oldest supported upgrading version, MediaWiki 1.35.

Some specific notes for MediaWiki 1.41 upgrades are below:
* (T178356) MediaWiki now requires browsers to support ES6 for them to receive
  JavaScript, up from ES5. In practice, this primarily means that users of
  Internet Explorer 11 (EOL in 2022) will no longer get JavaScript tools.

For notes on 1.40.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

=== Configuration changes for system administrators in 1.41 ===
* $wgGroupPermissions: The 'purge' permission is now considered an
  implicit right that can be rate limited, but not revoked. This has
  effectively already been the case for a long time, see T291316.

==== New configuration ====
* $wgPrivilegedGroups – Users belonging in some of the listed groups will be
  audited more aggressively.
* $wgPageLinksSchemaMigrationStage – This temporary flag lets you control the
  migration stage for converting the pagelinks database table into normal form.
* $wgExternalLinksDomainGaps – Can be used by large wikis to optimize certain
  external link queries.
* $wgResourceLoaderEnableSourceMapLinks - Add a SourceMap header to
  ResourceLoader responses for JavaScript modules (T47514).
* $wgVirtualDomainsMapping - Mapping of virtual domains to other dbs. It's
  useful to get connection to the external cluster.

==== Changed configuration ====
* $wgAuthManagerAutoConfig – When using this setting to modify the
  authentication system in MediaWiki, the classes
  TemporaryPasswordPrimaryAuthenticationProvider,
  LocalPasswordPrimaryAuthenticationProvider and
  EmailNotificationSecondaryAuthenticationProvider now require
  DBLoadBalancerFactory, not DBLoadBalancer, as a service.
* $wgUseFileCache is no longer used for ResourceLoader module caching.
* $wgLBFactoryConf['secret'] has been replaced by $wgChronologyProtectorSecret.

==== Removed configuration ====
* $wgCommentTempTableSchemaMigrationStage – This temporary flag did let you
  control the migration stage for the temporary comment database table, from
  revision.
* $wgExternalLinksSchemaMigrationStage – This temporary flag did let you
  control the migration stage for the externallinks database table.
* $wgParserOutputHooks - This array interacted with
  ParserOutput::addOutputHook(), which has been deprecated since 1.38 and was
  removed in this release.

=== New user-facing features in 1.41 ===
* Special:RandomPage can now take multiple namespaces in its URL, split by ','.
* The aria-level HTML attribute is now allowed in wikitext by the Sanitizer.

=== New features for sysadmins in 1.41 ===
* $wgDBssl can now enabled in the installer when the database type is
  Postgres or MariaDB/MySQL (T335828).
* MWHttpRequest will forward 'tracestate' and/or 'traceparent' headers when
  those are present in the original request and $wgAllowExternalReqID is set
  to true.
* MultiHttpClient will send X-Request-Id header and additionally will forward
  'tracestate' and/or 'traceparent' headers when those are present in the
  original request and $wgAllowExternalReqID is set to true.

=== New developer features in 1.41 ===
* Added ForeignResourcesDir extension.json / skin.json attribute, which should
  point to the directory holding your foreign-resources.yaml file. See
  https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Foreign_resources for background.
* Added PrivilegedGroups attribute for extension.json / skin.json, which lets
  you add any new user groups you define to wgPrivilegedGroups (see above).
* Added a .gitmessage commit template. To use it, run:
  `git config commit.template .gitmessage`
* A new hook, TextSlotDiffRendererTablePrefixHook, has been added to allow
  extensions to add content within #mw-content-text but after the
  DifferenceEngineViewHeader or DifferenceEngineShowDiffPage hooks have been
  run. The new hook is used to add elements within a horizontal display area,
  where their order can be explicitly set. Examples of uses for this include
  adding the VisualEditor diff-type switch, and the legend for inline diffs that
  is displayed if Wikidiff2 is installed.
* validation callbacks for HTMLForm fields can now return Status objects.
  HTMLForm::validate will convert good Status instances to true and Status
  instances to a string containing a list with the errors.
* ?action=rollback, if successful, will fire core's postEdit JavaScript hook;
  for now, we do *not* display a success message to the user via mw.notify(),
  as the RollbackAction form's success page is already shown
* MultiHttpClient constructor will accept `headers` property which defines a
  set of headers attached to every request performed by the client.
* New `Wikimedia/Http/TelemetryHeadersInterface` interface that provides a
  telemetry information which could be attached to HTTP Requests
* Wikimedia/Http/TelemetryHeadersInterface can be passed to MultiHttpClient
  via 'telemetry' option.
* UserRegistrationLookup adds support for multiple kinds of registration dates
  Extensions providing support for wiki-farm can use this to provide a global
  registration date (across all wikis), for example.
* When $wgUseXssLanguage is set to true (enabled by default in
  DevelopmentSettings.php), ?uselang=x-xss can be used to easily test
  whether all messages are being escaped correctly.
* Html::noticeBox accepts new optional parameters, 'heading' & 'iconClassName'.
  'heading' allows to pass an string as title; 'iconClassName' overwrites the
  default info icon.

* The following MagicWordArray methods have been removed or made private without
  deprecation. There were no known uses outside of the class.

=== Deprecations in 1.41 ===
* The MessageCache::get hook is deprecated for performance reasons. Use
  MessageCacheFetchOverrides instead.
* EtcdConfig::setLogger() is deprecated as it was unused and could not be
  used correctly. As a standalone class, its warnings now surface
  unconditionally via the native PHP error log.
* The interface for hook ParserModifyImageHTML have been renamed from
  ParserModifyImageHTML to ParserModifyImageHTMLHook,
  the old name is deprecated.
* (T178356) The es6-polyfills module is deprecated and is now a no-op.
* SerializedValueContainer::newUnified() is unused and now emits deprecation
  warnings.
* Profiler::setProfileID() and ::getAllowOutput() are now deprecated and also
  emit deprecation warnings. For ::setProfileID(), override the related class
  member directly in sub-class.
* (T166010) All PHP code in MediaWiki is slowly being moved to be in a class
  namespace as appropriate, so that we can use PSR-4 auto-loading, which will
  speed up general code loading of MediaWiki. The old global namespace class
  names are being left behind as deprecated aliases.

  In this release of MediaWiki, 1661 classes now have a namespace and 972 do

=== Other changes in 1.41 ===
* ExternalLinksLookup::getExternalLinksForPage() now exists to centralize

* The update script no longer accepts the --skip-compat-checks option.
* Use of the deprecated "Pragma: no-cache" HTTP response header on uncachable
  responses has been removed in favour of "Cache-Control: no-cache" (T345420).
* Type hints were added to:
   - The return value of WebRequest:: and DerivativeRequest::getSession()
   - The return value of WebRequest:: and DerivativeRequest::getIP()
   - The return value of User::getTitleKey()
   - The return value of User::getRequest()
   - The `$key` parameter to Skin::normalizeKey()
  None of the methods whose return value was updated belongs to a class
  stable to extend, and adding type hints to parameters is backwards
  compatible. Therefore, this is not considered a breaking change.
* The mergeMessageFileList script now only works for extensions and skins
  supporting extension registration (using extension.json or skin.json).
  It will no longer attempt to load PHP entry points.
* Parser will no longer fall back to $wgTitle if a null is provided as a
  Title or PageReference. To change the relevant title used for methods
  that do not offer an option to set the page, call Parser::setPage.
  This affects the methods cleanSig, getSection and replaceSection.
* (T347726, CVE-2023-PENDING) SECURITY: logging: Fix non-escaped messages
  used in rights log.
