THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.41 is an alpha-quality development branch, and is not recommended
for use in production.

== Upgrading notes for 1.41 ==
Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed per-version upgrade instructions from the
oldest supported upgrading version, MediaWiki 1.35.

Some specific notes for MediaWiki 1.41 upgrades are below:
* (T178356) MediaWiki now requires browsers to support ES6 for them to receive
  JavaScript, up from ES5. In practice, this primarily means that users of
  Internet Explorer 11 (EOL in 2022) will no longer get JavaScript tools.
