This file describes an alternative way of testing from that in README
since the README method didn't work for me.

 - Put a LocalSettings.php in the parent directory.  If you checked
   out mediawiki/trunk/phase3 as a directory called mediawiki, then
   this is where your LocalSettings.php file would go.
 - Install PHPUnit.  I used version 3.3.16 from Ubuntu.
   ("aptitude install phpunit").
 - Invoke phpunit directly instead of using make.  This uses the
   phpunit.xml file to run the tests.
 - Fix broken tests.
 - Label currently broken tests in the group Broken and they will not
   be run by phpunit.  You can add them to the group by putting the
   following comment at the top of the file:

    /**
     * @group Broken
     */



NOTE: I haven't yet determined why but my PHP installation would
sometimes segfault while linting the files.  PHPUnit uses "php -l" to
check file syntax and this is where the segfaults were happening.
