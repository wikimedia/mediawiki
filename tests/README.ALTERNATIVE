   out mediawiki/trunk/phase3 as a directory called mediawiki, then
   this would go in your 
 - Install PHPUnit.  I used version 3.3.16 from Ubuntu.
   ("aptitude install phpunit").
 - Invoke phpunit directly instead of using make.  This uses the
   phpunit.xml file to run the tests.
 - Fix broken tests.
 - Label currently broken tests in the group Broken and they will not
   be run by phpunit.  You can add them to the group by putting the
   following comment at the top of the file:

    /**
     * @group Broken
     */



NOTE: I haven't yet determined why but my PHP installation would
sometimes segfault while linting the files.  PHPUnit uses "php -l" to
check file syntax.
