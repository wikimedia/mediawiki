  <td class="diff-deletedline"><div>The '''red imported fire ant''' (''Solenopsis invicta''), also known as the '''fire ant''' or '''RIFA''', is a species of ant native to South America. A member of the genus ''[[Fire ant|Solenopsis]]'' in the subfamily [[Myrmicinae]], it was [[Species description|described]] by Swiss entomologist [[Felix Santschi]] as a variant in 1916. Its current name ''invicta'' was given to the ant in 1972 as a separate species. However, the variant and species were the same ant, and the name was preserved due to its wide use. The red imported fire ant is native to South America but it has been accidentally introduced in Australia, New Zealand, several Asian and Caribbean countries and the United States. The red imported fire ant is [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] as workers appear in different shapes and sizes. The ant's colours are red and somewhat yellowish with a brown or black [[Gaster (insect anatomy)|gaster]]. However, males are completely black. Red imported fire ants are dominant in altered areas and live in a wide variety of habitats. They can be found in: rain forests, in disturbed areas, deserts, grasslands, alongside roads and buildings, and in electrical equipment. Colonies form large mounds constructed from dirt with no visible entrances because foraging tunnels are built and workers emerge far away from the nest.</div></td>

  <td class="diff-context"><div>Venom plays an important role in the ant's life as it is used to capture prey or for defence. 95% of the venom's components are water-insoluble [[piperidine]] [[alkaloid]]s, and it is particularly potent on sensitive humans. More than 14 million people are stung by them in the United States annually, where many are expected to develop allergies to the venom. Most victims experience intense burning and swelling, followed by the formation of sterile [[Cutaneous condition|pustules]] which may remain for several days. However 0.6% to 6% of people may suffer from [[anaphylaxis]] which can be fatal if left untreated. Common symptoms include dizziness, chest pain, nausea, severe sweating, low blood pressure, loss of breath, and slurred speech. More than 80 deaths have been recorded from red imported fire ant attacks. Treatment depends on the symptoms; those who only experience pain and pustule formation require no medical attention, but those who suffer from anaphylaxis are given [[epinephrine]]s. Whole body extract immunotherapy is used to treat victims and is regarded as highly effective.</div></td>
