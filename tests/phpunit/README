== MediaWiki PHPUnit Tests ==

The unit tests for MediaWiki are implemented using the PHPUnit testing
framework and require PHPUnit to run.


=== WARNING ===

Some of the unit tests are DESTRUCTIVE and WILL ALTER YOUR WIKI'S CONTENTS.

DO NOT RUN THESE TESTS ON A PRODUCTION SYSTEM OR ON ANY SYSTEM WHERE YOU NEED
TO RETAIN YOUR DATA.


== Installation ==

If you used composer to install MediaWiki's dependencies PHPUnit will already be available, unless
you explicitly specified the --no-dev flag during the install. In this case just run "composer update".

Otherwise follow the installation instructions in the
PHPUnit Manual at:

  https://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/installation.html


== Running tests ==

The tests are run from your operating system's command line.

Ensure that you are in the tests/phpunit directory of your MediaWiki
installation.


On Unix-like operating systems, the tests runs are controlled with a makefile.
Run command:

  make help

for a full list of options for running tests.


On Windows-family operating systems, run the 'run-tests.bat' batch file.
