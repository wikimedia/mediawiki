# {{=}} will be converted to a parser function which expands to `=`
# If you have it defined as a Template that expands to something other
# than `=` that will generate a warning and a tracking category, although
# referencing the template explicitly as {{Template:=}} is fine
# regardless of what it expands to. (T91154)
!! test
Using {{=}} when that doesn't expand to "=" should create a tracking category
!! options
cat
!! wikitext
This uses {{=}}.
!! html/php
cat=Pages_which_use_=_as_a_template sort=
!! end

!! test
Using {{Template:=}} shouldn't create tracking category regardless of definition

This uses {{Template:=}}.
