== MediaWiki 1.40.0-PRERELEASE ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.40 is an alpha-quality development branch, and is not recommended
for use in production.

== Upgrading notes for 1.40 ==
Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed per-version upgrade instructions from the
oldest supported upgrading version, MediaWiki 1.35.

Some specific notes for MediaWiki 1.40 upgrades are below:
* …

For notes on 1.39.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

=== Configuration changes for system administrators in 1.40 ===
* When computing PBKDF2 password hashes, MediaWiki now detects and uses OpenSSL
  support if available, unless $wgPasswordConfig['pbkdf2']['class'] is set in
  LocalSettings.php. OpenSSL is more efficient, so if that setting is present,
  you should remove it (or set it to 'Pbkdf2PasswordUsingOpenSSL' if possible).
  If users get an internal error when trying to log in, you can try setting it
  to 'Pbkdf2PasswordUsingHashExtension'. In particular, this would be necessary
  if existing PBKDF2 password hashes were computed using a hash algorithm other
  than "sha512" or "sha256" (the current and prior defaults).
* …

==== New configuration ====
* $wgThumbnailNamespaces - Defines what namespaces thumbnails will be displayed
  for in Special:Search. This is the list of namespaces for which thumbnails
  (or a placeholder in the absence of a thumbnail) will be shown.
* …

==== Changed configuration ====
* wgPasswordPolicies – This setting, which controls what makes for a valid
  password for wiki accounts, has been adjusted to raise the minimal password
  length from 1 to 8 characters. The initial limit of 1 has been in place since
  MediaWiki 1.26. If you wish to allow shorter passwords, you can over-ride it
  in your LocalSettings following the guidance on MediaWiki.org.
* …

==== Removed configuration ====
* $wgShellboxUrl that was deprecated in 1.37 has now been removed,
  set $wgShellboxUrls instead.
* $wgParserTestFiles which was deprecated in 1.30 has now been removed;
  extensions can place their parser test files in `tests/parser` instead.
* …

=== New user-facing features in 1.40 ===
* Ability to show thumbnails (provided via onSearchResultProvideThumbnail
  hook) for more than NS_FILE titles in Special:Search results.
* New preference ('search-thumbnail-extra-namespaces') to allow users to
  control whether to show more thumbnails (per $wgThumbnailNamespaces)
* …

=== New developer features in 1.40 ===
* The ApiSandbox will now by default request responses in the latest API format,
  rather than the original format. Users can set `formatversion` to a different
  value if needed.
* (T277618) The @noVarDump annotation from the DebugInfoTrait tool can now be
  added to references to stop them from being expanded when their object is
  passed to var_dump(), to make its use for debugging more feasible.
* Added 'GetBlockErrorMessageKey' hook, allow extensions'
  block error messages to be received and displayed by BlockErrorFormatter.
* Added an optional RevisionRecord param to:
  - ContentHandler::getParserOutputForIndexing
  - ContentHandler::getDataForSearchIndex
  - the SearchDataForIndex hook is deprecated in favor of SearchDataForIndex2
* …
