== Upgrading notes for 1.40 ==
Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed per-version upgrade instructions from the
oldest supported upgrading version, MediaWiki 1.35.

Some specific notes for MediaWiki 1.40 upgrades are below:
* Maintenance scripts should now be executed using maintenance/run.php, e.g.
  maintenance/run.php update not maintenance/update.php as before.
* Four extensions have now been bundled with MediaWiki:
  * The Echo extension, which provides a system of user notifications.
  * The Linter extension, which warns about use of deprecated wikitext.
  * The LoginNotify extension, which warns users about failed attempted logins.
  * The Thanks extension, which lets users thank editors for edits.
* The Renameuser extension has been moved to MediaWiki core. It is now possible
  to rename users without installing an extension. The extension had already
  been bundled with MediaWiki since 1.18.

For notes on 1.39.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

=== Configuration changes for system administrators in 1.40 ===
* When computing PBKDF2 password hashes, MediaWiki now detects and uses OpenSSL
  support if available, unless $wgPasswordConfig['pbkdf2']['class'] is set in
  LocalSettings.php. OpenSSL is more efficient, so if that setting is present,
  you should remove it (or set it to 'Pbkdf2PasswordUsingOpenSSL' if possible).
  If users get an internal error when trying to log in, you can try setting it
  to 'Pbkdf2PasswordUsingHashExtension'. In particular, this would be necessary
  if existing PBKDF2 password hashes were computed using a hash algorithm other
  than "sha512" or "sha256" (the current and prior defaults).
* You should configure your webserver to return the http header
  'X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff' for the /images directory. This will
  instruct browsers to not apply content sniffing when accessing the files.
  MediaWiki before 1.40 shipped with a content sniffer which disallowed
  potentially dangerous files at upload time, but this protection has now been
  removed in favor of this 'X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff' header and the
  installer will return a warning when it is not in place.
* Support for MW_USE_LEGACY_DEFAULT_SETTINGS has been removed, setting this
  constant will not have any effect. Use of MW_USE_LEGACY_DEFAULT_SETTINGS
  had been deprecated since 1.39.

==== New configuration ====
* $wgThumbnailNamespaces - This setting lets you define the namespaces for which
  image thumbnails (or a placeholder in the absence of a thumbnail) will be
  displayed on Special:Search.
* $wgResourceLoaderClientPreferences – This experimental flag lets you enable
  client-side preferences for logged-out users.
* $wgExternalLinksSchemaMigrationStage – This temporary flag lets you control
  the migration stage for the new schema for the external links database table.
  Ignore it unless you have a large wiki farm with complex migration needs.
* $wgCommentTempTableSchemaMigrationStage – This temporary flag lets you control
  the migration stage for the temporary comment database table, from revision.
  Ignore it unless you have a large wiki farm with complex migration needs.
* $wgSpecialContributeSkinsEnabled – This setting lets you list skins on which
  Special:Contribute is available, for where others don't work for the feature.

==== Changed configuration ====
* $wgPasswordPolicies – This setting, which controls what makes for a valid
  password for wiki accounts, has been adjusted to raise the minimal password
  length from 1 to 8 characters. The initial limit of 1 has been in place since
  MediaWiki 1.26. If you wish to allow shorter passwords, you can over-ride it
  in your LocalSettings following the guidance on MediaWiki.org.
* (T254045) New accounts can no longer use an equals sign (=) in their
  usernames because of issues it causes in wikitext syntax. This can be
  adjusted by changing the value of $wgInvalidUsernameCharacters.
* (T314318) $wgParserEnableLegacyMediaDOM – This setting has been changed, so
  the alternative modern HTML structure for media is now the default. You can
  disable it for now by over-riding this back to `true` in LocalSettings, but
  this configuration will be removed in future versions of MediaWiki. For more
  details, see the documentation at:
  https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Parsoid/Parser_Unification/Media_structure/FAQ
* $wgWatchlistExpiryMaxDuration – This setting, which controls the maximum
  allowed duration for users to set their temporary watchlist entries for expiry
  if that feature is enabled, has been increased from 6 months to 1 year.

==== Removed configuration ====
* $wgShellboxUrl – This setting, deprecated in 1.37, has now been removed; use
  $wgShellboxUrls instead.
* $wgMainWANCache and $wgWANObjectCaches – These never-used settings have been
  removed. To inject WANObjectCache parameters, use $wgWANObjectCache instead.
  These variables were introduced for multi-DC wiki farms to add a separate
  memcached proxy for cross-DC relaying of purges but never used because
  WANObjectCache works based on route prefixes, which can be transparently
  handled by the main memcached proxy.
* $wgParserTestFiles – This setting, deprecated in 1.30, has now been removed;
  extensions can place their parser test files in `tests/parser` instead.
* (T231412) $wgAutoloadAttemptLowercase – This setting, deprecated in 1.35, no
  longer has any effect. If you run into difficulties, fix the names of miscased
  local files.
* (T309787) $wgVerifyMimeTypeIE – This setting, to provide extra security checks
  for very old versions of Internet Explorer clients, was removed. These user
  agents aren't used in practice, and haven't been served JavaScript content for
  years.

=== New user-facing features in 1.40 ===
* Special:Search can now show thumbnails for results for titles outside NS_FILE.
  This is controlled via the new onSearchResultProvideThumbnail hook.
* A new preference ('search-thumbnail-extra-namespaces') to allow users to
  control whether to show more thumbnails (per $wgThumbnailNamespaces)
* (T324910) On pages using multi-content revisions, the raw content of a
  specific slot can be retrieved using the action=raw&slot=<role-name> query
  parameters.
* (T313804) The preferences page now provides a search bar to find preferences,
  regardless of the tab on which they appear.

=== New developer features in 1.40 ===
* The MediaWiki-Docker development environment is now configured to
  run on PHP 8.1 by default, up from PHP 7.4 now that that's EOL.
* Vue development mode is enabled by default in DevelopmentSettings.php
* (T277618) The @noVarDump annotation from the DebugInfoTrait tool can now be
  added to references to stop them from being expanded when their object is
  passed to var_dump(), to make its use for debugging more feasible.
* The ApiSandbox will now by default request responses in the latest API format,
  rather than the original format. Users can set `formatversion` to a different
  value if needed.
* A new hook, GetBlockErrorMessageKeyHook, allows extensions' block error
  messages to be received and displayed by BlockErrorFormatter.
* A new hook, SpecialCreateAccountBenefits, lets extensions and local code set
  custom content on the signup page about the benefits of using an account.
* (T321412) A new 'PageUndeleteComplete' hook has been added for more thorough
  information about a page post restoration than the 'PageUndelete' hook passes.
  This provides similar functionality to the 'PageDeleteComplete' hook.
* The Linker::specialLink() method can now link to a Special page's with a sub-
  page or action parameter set, e.g. [[Special:Contributions/JohnDoe]].
* The PHPUnit entrypoints (tests/phpunit/phpunit.php and vendor/bin/phpunit)
  now check if composer dependencies are up-to-date, like update.php, using
  CheckComposerLockUpToDate. To disable this check, use
  MW_SKIP_EXTERNAL_DEPENDENCIES=1 environment flag when running PHPUnit.
* ManualLogEntry::setForceBotFlag() has been added to allow the forcing of the
  bot flag for log entries which are inserted to the recent changes.

=== Other changes in 1.40 ===
* Calling RecentChange::doMarkPatrolled() with $auto = true has no effect and
  logs a warning. Since 1.31, it would mark the change as manually patrolled,
  but would not log it as such in patrol log and would still require
  'autopatrol' right (not 'patrol'). Generally, whether a change should become
  autopatrolled, is usually determined before it's inserted in the database.
* In versions of MediaWiki before 1.39, the table of contents location
  was marked internally with <mw:toc>...</mw:toc>; in version 1.39
  this was changed to an empty tag <mw:tocplace />.  In 1.40 this has
  been changed a final time to use an empty <meta> tag for future
  Parsoid compatibility (see Parser::TOC_PLACEHOLDER).  This may
  affect you if stale content is left in the ParserCache or if your
  skin did manual ToC replacement without using the recommended
  Parser::replaceTableOfContentsMarker() function.
* Skins can now choose which Codex theme should be loaded by setting the
  SkinCodexThemes attribute in their skin.json file.
* The parser test framework has been updated, and the 'pst', 'ill', 'cat'
  and 'showflags' options have slight differences in their output.  These
  options are not much used outside core, but third parties may need to
  update parser tests.
* (T332889, CVE-2023-36675) SECURITY: Fix escaping in BlockLogFormatter.
