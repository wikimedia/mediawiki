This is the "Phase III" codebase for the Wikipedia project
(http://www.wikipedia.org). It is possibly usable as a
general-purpose wiki, but it was not intended as such and
there is little or no support available for using it as such
from the developers, who are busy full time supporting the
Wikipedia project. There are many good general-purpose Wikis
in the world. I personally recommend UseMod
(http://www.usemod.com/).

The code as a whole is Copyright 2002,2003 by
Lee Daniel Crocker, Magnus Manske, Jan Hidders, Brion Vibber,

others, licensed under the terms of the
GNU General Public License, version 2 (see

later versions of the code will also be considered free
software licensed under the same terms.

Sections of code written exclusively by Lee Crocker are also
released into the public domain, wich does not impair the
obligations of users under the GPL for use of the whole code
or other sections thereof.

Many thanks to the Wikipedia regulars for testing and
suggestions.

The code is currently maintained at Sourceforge under the
project "wikipedia", module name "phase3". You can view the
code in CVS, report bugs and make feature requests there:

The code is written in PHP. It was tested mainly on version
4.06, but it is known to run in later versions. It requires
MySQL 3.23 or later, and PHP-MySQL. It is now running with
PHP 4.2.2 and MySQL 3.23.49 at http://www.wikipedia.org .
The code was written on and for Linux, and no attempt has
been made to make it portable to other OSs, though it may
happen to run on some.  The math support in particular has
run-time dependencies on things like TeTeX and GhostScript
that are generally found in Linux but not other OSs.
