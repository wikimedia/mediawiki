MediaWiki
---------

MediaWiki is the software used for Wikipedia (http://www.wikipedia.org) and the
other Wikimedia Foundation websites. Compared to other wikis, it has an
excellent range of features and support for high-traffic websites using
multiple servers (Wikipedia peaks in the 2500+ requests per second range
as of June 2005).

While quite usable on smaller sites, you may find you have to "roll your own"
local documentation, and some aspects of configuration may seem overcomplicated
because MediaWiki is primarily targeted as an in-house tool.

See the files RELEASE-NOTES, INSTALL, and UPGRADE for details on system
requirements and installation procedure.
