MediaWiki
---------

MediaWiki is the software used for Wikipedia
(http://www.wikipedia.org) and the other Wikimedia
Foundation websites. Compared to other wikis, it has an
excellent range of features and support for high-traffic
websites. However, it is generally harder to install. Be
sure to follow the INSTALL document closely. Installation on
a Microsoft Windows system is not recommended, however it is 
possible. Documentation for installation on Windows may be 
found at:

The MediaWiki software was written by:

* Lee Daniel Crocker
* Magnus Manske
* Jan Hidders
* Brion Vibber
* Axel Boldt
* Geoffrey T. Dairiki
* Tomasz Wegrzanowski
* Erik Moeller
* Tim Starling
* Several others

The newly-founded Wikimedia Foundation currently has no
legal rights to the software, although copyright may be
assigned to it at a later date. Wikimedia has not funded 
any of the development work.

Sections of code written exclusively by Lee Crocker or Erik
Moeller are also released into the public domain, which does

Many thanks to the Wikipedia regulars for testing and
suggestions.

The code is currently maintained at Sourceforge under the
project "wikipedia", module name "phase3". You can view the
code in CVS, report bugs and make feature requests there:

If you are setting up your own wiki based on this software, 
it is highly recommended that you subscribe to mediawiki-l:

  http://mail.wikipedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-l

The mailing list is very low volume, and is intended primarily 
for announcements of new versions, bug fixes, and security 
issues. 

PHP

The code is written in PHP. Version 4.3.2 or higher is 
recommended. There are known issues with early 4.2.x
releases. 

MySQL

MediaWiki requires MySQL 3.23 or later, and PHP-MySQL.
Version 4.0 or later is strongly recommended

Operating system

The code was written on and for Linux, and no attempt 
has been made to make it portable to other OSs. The 
math support in particular has run-time dependencies on 
things like TeTeX and GhostScript that are generally 
found in  Linux but not other OSs. However, we have had 
reports of successful installation on Windows, albeit
without TeX support.
