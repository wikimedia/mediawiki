== MediaWiki ==

MediaWiki is a popular and free, open-source wiki software package written in
PHP. It serves as the platform for Wikipedia and the other projects of the Wikimedia
Foundation, which deliver content in over 280 languages to more than half a billion
people each month. MediaWiki's reliability and robust feature set have earned it a
large and vibrant community of third-party users and developers.

MediaWiki is:

* feature-rich and extensible, both on-wiki and with over 2,000 extensions;
* scalable and suitable for both small and large sites;
* available in your language; and
* simple to install, working on most hardware/software combinations.

For system requirements, installation, and upgrade details, see the files
RELEASE-NOTES, INSTALL, and UPGRADE.
