== MediaWiki 1.42.0-PRERELEASE ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.42 is an alpha-quality development branch, and is not recommended
for use in production.

== Upgrading notes for 1.42 ==
Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed per-version upgrade instructions from the
oldest supported upgrading version, MediaWiki 1.35.

Some specific notes for MediaWiki 1.42 upgrades are below:
* MediaWiki now requires Composer 2.x, and any related (vendor) files generated
  by Composer must be generated by Composer 2.x. Composer 1.x is mostly end of
  life by upstream, and using it will result in slower actions when downloading
  and installing packages. See the upstream blog post at
  https://blog.packagist.com/deprecating-composer-1-support/ for further
  information.
* …

For notes on 1.41.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

=== Configuration changes for system administrators in 1.42 ===
* Composer 1.x is no longer supported, and can no longer be used with MediaWiki.
* …

==== New configuration ====
* $wgMicroStashType: The object cache backend for the MicroStash service.
* $wgEditRecoveryExpiry: Number of seconds to keep edit recovery data
  after the edit is stored.
* $wgDjvuUseBoxedCommand and $wgDjvuShell: A temporary flag to control whether
  or not to use BoxedCommand when wrapping DejaVu rendering, and the command to
  call if so.
* $wgConditionalUserOptions: Makes it possible to define user properties with
  defaults varying by user, without growing the user_properties table. Typical
  use-case is to enable a feature only for users created after a certain date.
* $wgGrantRiskGroups: Grant risk levels, used to indicate on various UIs which
  grants should be considered risky. (T290790)
* $wgTempAccountCreationThrottle: Like AccountCreationThrottle, but for managing
  temporary account creations.
* …

==== Changed configuration ====
* $wgAutoCreateTempUser: 'matchPattern' now supports multiple match patterns.
* $wgLogActionsHandlers is now ObjectFactory compatible.
* $wgBotPasswordsCluster and $wgBotPasswordsDatabase have been deprecated
  use $wgVirtualDomainsMapping['virtual-botpasswords'] instead.
* The MainPageIsDomainRoot setting is no longer considered experimental.
* $wgAutoCreateTempUser is updated to use a different format for temporary
  accounts. This configuration value is marked as unstable, so breaking
  changes were expected. If your wiki used temporary accounts before
  1.42, you will need to override the configuration value to also match
  the old format of *$1.
* …

==== Removed configuration ====
* $wgDisableCookieCheck has been removed.
* $wgStatsCacheType has been removed. Set $wgMicroStashType instead.
* $wgJobSerialCommitThreshold has been removed without deprecation,
  it wasn't used anywhere according to codesearch and any setups using this
  config will perform just fine but might be less performant.
* $wgLogoHD, deprecated since 1.35, has been removed. Use $wgLogo instead.
* $wgContentHandlerTextFallback, deprecated since 1.37, has been removed.
  No longer customizable.
* $wgSquidPurgeUseHostHeader, deprecated since 1.33, has been removed.
  No longer customizable and always true.
* $wgAllowImageTag, deprecated since 1.35, has been removed.
  Register an extension tag named <img> instead.
* $wgMinimalPasswordLength and $wgMaximalPasswordLength, deprecated since 1.26
  have been dropped. Use $wgPasswordPolicy instead.
* $wgUseMediaWikiUIEverywhere has been removed.
* $wgHTMLFormAllowTableFormat has been removed.
* $wgOpenSearchTemplate, deprecated since 1.25, has been removed
  Use $wgOpenSearchTemplates['application/x-suggestions+json'] instead.
* $wgUseSameSiteLegacyCookies has been removed.
* …

=== New user-facing features in 1.42 ===
* (T308160) filter: is now allowed in inline CSS in wikitext
* …

=== New features for sysadmins in 1.42 ===
* …

=== New developer features in 1.42 ===
* (T326466) MediaWikiIntegrationTestCase's database and set-up code now avoids
  using dynamic properties, which was causing deprecation warnings in PHP 8.2.
* (T13555) MediaWiki now includes styles that allow more accessible markup for
  section headings. MediaWiki's own HTML output will be changed in the future.
  More information: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Heading_HTML_changes
* (T193472) PHP Notice and Warning errors that are silenced (e.g. by the "@"
  operator, error_reporting directive, or Wikimedia\AtEase) are now logged to
  a new "silenced-error" channel.
* (T347347) The CLI installer accepts a "--with-developmentsettings" argument
  to require the DevelopmentSettings.php file at install time.
* (T350054) MediaWiki's ResourceLoader has been updated to add basic support
  for code-splitting (aka "tree-shaking") when using the Codex component
  library. A ResourceLoader module can now specify a list of "codexComponents"
  in its module defintion and ensure that only the code for those components
  gets sent to the client. More information:
  https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Codex#Subset_of_components
* (T345185) The SessionProviderInterface now allows defining providers that
  are exempt from rights checks when auto creating users.
* …

=== Breaking changes in 1.42 ===
* (T340802) ResourceLoader: The targets system is no longer active; all modules
  will load on all platforms even if they are marked as desktop- or mobile-only
  in the 'targets' field, which is no longer read. As part of this, the internal
  methods RL\Module::setTarget() & ::getTargets(), and OutputPage::setTarget(),
  have been removed.
* TitleArray, deprecated since 1.41, has been removed.
* UserRightsProxy, deprecated since 1.38, has been removed.
* SiteConfiguration::getConfig(), deprecated in 1.41, has been removed.
* UserLoginCompleteHook is always called with its $direct parameter set to
  boolean true. The false case has been removed.
* MagicWord::load() has been marked @internal and may change in the future
  without further notice.
* All classes that implemented IDBAccessObject interface and all interfaces
  that extended it, no longer do that. See https://w.wiki/9DAX for more info.
* BagOStuff::setNewPreparedValues() now emits deprecation warnings.
* The type of the last parameter of BeforeInitializeHook::onBeforeInitialize
  and MediaWikiPerformActionHook::onMediaWikiPerformAction changed from
  MediaWiki to ActionEntryPoint. Relevant methods are still available on
  the object.
* Classes that override Maintenance::finalSetup() must now declare the
  $settings parameter and pass it on when calling the parent implementation.
  MaintenanceRunner will always provide this parameter when calling
  finalSetup().
* WebResponse::disableForPostSend() is no longer static.
* MediaWiki's virtualrest internal library has been removed in favor of the
  HTTP library like: Guzzle, MultiHttpClient or MwHttpRequest.
* Several deprecated methods have been removed from the Content interface,
  in favor of the respective methods in ContentHandlers. Callers should
  use a more narrow interface like ContentRenderer or ContentTransformer
  when possible. The following methods have been removed from Content:
  - getParserOutput()
  - preSaveTransform()
  - preloadTransform()
  - prepareSave()
* User::blockedFor() and AbstractBlock::getReason(), deprecated in 1.35, have
  been removed. Use AbstractBlock::getReasonComment() instead.
* SerializedValueContainer::newUnified(), deprecated in 1.41 has been removed.
* Use of ActorMigration for any of the following tables, deprecated since 1.34,
  is no longer supported:
  - archive
  - image
  - oldimage
  - filearchive
  - recentchanges
  - logging
  - ipblocks
* ParserOutput::setFlag() and ::getFlag(), deprecated in 1.38, were removed. You
  should use ::setOutputFlag() and ::getOutputFlag() instead.
* ParserOutput::getCategories(), deprecated in 1.40, has been removed. You
  should use ::getCategoryNames() and ::getCategorySortKey() instead.
* ParserOutput::getTOCHTML(), deprecated in 1.40, has been removed. You should
  use ::getTOCData() instead.
* The parser does not substitute the default category sort key at
  parse time; this is substituted when the category links table is
  updated instead.  As a result {{DEFAULTSORT}} will affect all the
  contents of the page (not just categories added after the location
  of {{DEFAULTSORT}} in the article) and
  ParserOutput::getCategorySortKey() will return the empty string
  (still meaning "use the default sort key") instead of the immediate
  value of {{DEFAULTSORT}}.  ParserOutput::getCategorySortKey() will
  directly reflect the category link contents, instead of having
  postprocessing done to it (character references decoded, newlines
  replaced, language conversion).  That postprocessing is now done
  when the category links table is updated, and so it consistently
  applies even when categories are added directly via API.
* PostgresUpdater::addPgEnumValue() unused everywhere, have been removed
  without deprecation. Use of ENUM is highly discouraged.
* ILoadBalancer::getAnyOpenConnection() has been removed without deprecation,
  use ::getConnection() instead.
* The unused method CommentStore::getFields() has been removed without
  depreaction.
* LanguageConverter's internal properties, all deprecated in 1.35 or 1.36, have
  now had their deprecated property accessors dropped:
  - mConvRuleTitle
  - mUserVariant
  - mHeaderVariant
  - mMaxDepth
  - mVarSeparatorPattern
  - mLangObj
  - mTablesLoaded
  - mTables
  - mVariants
  - mMainLanguageCode
  - mVariantFallbacks
  - mFlags
  - mVariantNames
  - mDescCodeSep
  - mDescVarSep
* OutputPage::addParserOutputText has been marked @internal since there are no
  known users of it. Its old behavior has been deprecated and will change
  in the future without further notice.
* Some methods of ConnectionManager and SessionConsistentConnectionManager,
  previously deprecated, have been removed:
  - ::releaseConnection(), deprecated in 1.38; do not use
  - ::getWriteConnectionRef(), deprecated in 1.39; use getWriteConnection()
  - ::getReadConnectionRef(), deprecated in 1.38; use getReadConnection()
  - ::getLazyWriteConnectionRef(), deprecated in 1.39; use getWriteConnection()
  - ::getLazyReadConnectionRef(), deprecated in 1.38; use getReadConnection()
* CoreParserFunctions::mwnamespace(), deprecated in 1.39, has been removed. Use
  CoreParserFunctions::namespace() instead.
* Processor:: and ExtensionProcessor::getExtraAutoloaderPaths(), deprecated in
  1.39, have been removed; use ::getExtractedAutoloadInfo() instead.
* MWExceptionHandler::rollbackMasterChangesAndLog(), deprecated in 1.37, has
  been removed. Use ::rollbackPrimaryChangesAndLog() instead.
* Passing a custom database connection to DatabaseBlockStore::insertBlock(),
  deprecated since 1.41, is no longer supported.
* LanguageConverterFactory::isTitleConversionDisabled(), deprecated in 1.36,
  has been removed. Use ::isLinkConversionDisabled() instead.
* Passing an actor id to the constructor of UserIdentityValue, deprecated
  since 1.36, is no longer being supported.
* Support for setting dynamic property on StatusValue object has been removed.
  To pass your arbitrary data along the object, use StatusValue::statusData
  property (which is always declared).
* The global function wfReportTime(), deprecated since 1.40, has been removed.
* The skin template parameter 'reporttime', deprecated since 1.41, has been
  removed.
* WikiPage::getPageIsRedirectField(), deprecated since 1.41, has been removed.
* WikiPage::insertRedirect(), deprecated since 1.41, has been removed.
* Several methods in PageArchive, all deprecated in 1.38, have been removed:
  - ::listRevisions()
  - ::getRevisionRecordByTimestamp()
  - ::getArchivedRevisionRecord()
  - ::getPreviousRevisionRecord()
  - ::getLastRevisionId()
  - ::isDeleted()
  - ::getFileStatus()
  - ::getRevisionStatus()
* Database, DatabaseInstaller, DatabaseUpdater, DBPrimaryPos, ResultWrapper and
  SQLPlatform are no longer stable to extend. It is not possible to define
  database types in an extension.
* UserDef::PARAM_ALLOWED_USER_TYPES now differentiates between temporary account
  usernames and user accounts. Any endpoints that want temp users to be
  valid but were passing a name through will break. Temp users must now be
  explicitly allowed.
* The Hooks class, a legacy wrapper for HooksContainer, has been removed. All of
  its contents have been previously deprecated in 1.35 (or 1.41 for ::runner()):
  - ::register()
  - ::clear(),
  - ::isRegistered()
  - ::getHandlers()
  - ::run()
  - ::runWithoutAbort()
  - ::runner()
* Article::__get(), ::__set(), deprecated since 1.35, have been removed.
* Several API calls have been updated to return a 'temp' user flag:
  - ApiQueryImageInfo
  - ApiQueryLogEvents
  - ApiQueryRecentChanges
  - APIs extended from ApiQueryRevisionsBase
* Parser::getCustomDefaultSort() and ::setDefaultSort(), deprecated since 1.38,
  have been removed.
* UserOptionsLookup::getDefaultOptions() and
  UserOptionsLookup::getDefaultOption() now accept an UserIdentity, to
  take conditional defaults for user properties into account. When conditional
  defaults are used, calling those methods without the UserIdentity might
  produce unexpected results.
* Installer related classes have been namespaced without having aliases added.
  The following have been moved to MediaWiki\Installer:
  - CliInstaller
  - DatabaseInstaller
  - InstallDocFormatter
  - Installer
  - InstallerOverrides
  - InstallerSessionProvider

=== Deprecations in 1.42 ===
* (T273239) wfGetDB(), deprecated in 1.39, now emits deprecation warnings. Most
  code can migrate to MediaWikiServices::getInstance()->getConnectionProvider()
  ->getReplicaDatabase() or …->getPrimaryDatabase() as appropriate.
* (T166010) All PHP code in MediaWiki is slowly being moved to be in a class
  namespace as appropriate, so that we can use PSR-4 auto-loading, which will
  speed up general code loading of MediaWiki. The old global namespace class
  names are being left behind as deprecated aliases.
