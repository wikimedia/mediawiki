=== Deprecations in 1.42 ===
* (T166010) All PHP code in MediaWiki is slowly being moved to be in a class
  namespace as appropriate, so that we can use PSR-4 auto-loading, which will
  speed up general code loading of MediaWiki. The old global namespace class
  names are being left behind as deprecated aliases.

  In this release of MediaWiki, XYZ classes now have a namespace and XYZ do
  not yet (XYZ% done, up from 63% in MediaWiki 1.41.0). The following have newly
  been moved:
  - MediaWiki\Deferred:
    - AtomicSectionUpdate
    - AutoCommitUpdate
    - CdnCacheUpdate
    - DataUpdate
    - DeferrableCallback
    - DeferrableUpdate
    - DeferredUpdates
    - DeferredUpdatesScope
    - DeferredUpdatesScopeMediaWikiStack
    - DeferredUpdatesScopeStack
    - EnqueueableDataUpdate
    - HtmlFileCacheUpdate
    - JobQueueEnqueueUpdate
    - MWCallableUpdate
    - MergeableUpdate
    - MessageCacheUpdate
    - SearchUpdate
    - SendPasswordResetEmailUpdate
    - SiteStatsUpdate

    - SiteLookup
    - SiteStore
* API modules using ApiBase::requirePostedParameters() must also override
  mustBePosted() to return true.
* Using `new ImportReporter( … )` or `new ApiImportReporter( … )` without
  the $context parameter is now deprecated.
* Using `WikiImporterFactory::getWikiImporter()` without the $performer
  parameter is now deprecated.
* BlockManager::getUserBlock() was deprecated. Instead use
  BlockManager::getBlock(), which expects the caller to do ipblock-exempt
  checking.
* User::isBlocked(), ::isBlockedFromCreateAccount() and ::isBlockedFrom() now
  emit deprecation warnings. They were deprecated since 1.34, 1.37 and 1.33
  respectively.

  Instead use DatabaseBlockStore::newFromID().
* DatabaseBlock::getAutoblockExpiry() was deprecated without replacement.
* MagicWord::getId() has been deprecated.
* MagicWordFactory::getSubstIDs() has been deprecated.
* Status::setMessageLocalizer is deprecated. Callers that want to control the
  localization of the Status object should obtain a StatusFormatter from
  the StatusFormatterFactory.
* Vuex has been deprecated in favor of its successor, Pinia. Though deprecated,
  Vuex 4 will remain accessible for the foreseeable future. Pinia should be used
  for new projects.
* Title::getBrokenLinksFrom() has been deprecated.
* ReplicatedBagOStuff has been deprecated since 1.42.
* ParserOutput::setLanguageLinks() has been deprecated.
* ApiQueryBlockInfoTrait::addBlockInfoToQuery() will emit deprecation warnings
  and will soon stop working due to schema changes. Instead use
  addDeletedUserFilter() or getBlockDetailsForRows().
* UploadBase::getImageInfo was deprecated, subclasses of ApiUpload can use
  ApiUpload::getUploadImageInfo() instead.
* DatabaseBlockStore::updateTimestamp() is now internal and should not be
  called.
* The module `mediawiki.icon` has been deprecated. Use the Codex mixin instead
  (T351681).
* Passing a WikiPage to PageEditStash::parseAndCache() has been deprecated.
  Use PageUpdater instance.
* SpecialBlock::getSuggestedDurations() has been deprecated, use
  Language::getBlockDurations() instead.
* (T352284) Some user options-related classes were moved over to the existing
  MediaWiki\User\Options namespace. Old names are deprecated and kept as
  aliases for backwards-compatibility:
   - DefaultOptionsLookup
   - UserOptionsLookup
   - UserOptionsManager
   - StaticUserOptionsLookup
* Database::listViews() has been deprecated. This was previously used to filter
  views out of the return value of Database::listTables(). Now listTables()
  will not include views. MediaWiki does not use views.
* …
