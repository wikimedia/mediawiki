'''Washington, DC''', officially the '''District of Columbia''' (also known as '''DC'''; '''Washington'''; and, historically, '''the Federal City''') is the [[capital (government)|capital]] city and administrative district of the [[United States|United States of America]].  Residents of the city and its surrounding [[suburb]]s refer to it simply as '''the District''' or '''DC''', to contrast Washington from its greater metropolitan area.

'''Washington, DC''' is the most common way to refer to the District throughout the rest of the United States and the world. '''Washington''' or '''Washington, DC''' is also used as a [[metonym]] for the federal government. Politicians and candidates for office sometimes use these terms pejoratively to convey a sense of solidarity with their [[constituent]]s by distancing themselves from the negative image of an out-of-touch centralized government. (The [[Washington Post]] criticized this common political tactic in a 2001 [http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&contentId=A22140-2001Aug30&notFound=true editorial].)

The District of Columbia is not part of any [[U.S. State|state]], but rather composes a unique, [[Federal Government of the United States|federally]] managed district within the United States, with limited local rule.  As the seat of national government as well as the home of numerous national landmarks, museums, and sports teams, Washington is a popular international destination for [[tourist]]s and school trips.

The centers of all three branches of the U.S. [[federal]] [[government]] are in Washington, as well as the headquarters of most [[Independent Agencies of the United States Government|federal agencies]].  Washington also serves as the headquarters for the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], and the [[Organization of American States]].  All of this has made Washington the frequent focal point of massive political demonstrations and [[protest]]s, particularly on the [[National Mall]].

The population of Washington, as of [[2003]] U.S. Census Bureau estimates, is 563,384. Despite being smaller in area than the smallest state ([[Rhode Island]]), it has a larger population than the least populous state ([[Wyoming]]).  Together with portions of [[Virginia]] and [[Maryland]], and [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] and its environs, Washington is part of a large [[metropolitan area]] known as the [[Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area]]. In recent years, the metro area has expanded to include communities as far away as [[West Virginia]], [[Delaware]], and [[Pennsylvania]].

The official bird of Washington DC is the [[Wood thrush]].  The official motto is ''Justitia Omnibus'' (Justice for All).

== Law and government ==

<div style="float: left; margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 10px; text-align: center;"> [[Image:Dctaxationsample_small.jpg|License plate reading Washington, D.C. at the top and Taxation Without Representation at the bottom]]<br><small>''DC License Plate''</small></div>

Residents of the District vote for the [[President of the United States of America|President]] but do not have voting representation in [[United States Congress|Congress]]. Citizens of Washington are represented in the House of Representatives by a [[Shadow Representative|non-voting Delegate]], who sits on committees and participates in debate, but cannot vote. DC does not have representation in the Senate. Citizens of Washington, DC are thus unique in the world, as citizens of the capital city of every other country have the same representation rights as their fellow citizens.

There have been efforts to attain voting representation for many years, including the [[District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment]] passed by Congress in 1978 but unratified by the states.  These efforts are endorsed by the current Mayor, [[Anthony Williams]] and by the current Delegate, [[Eleanor Holmes Norton]]. So, while the District's official motto is "Justitia omnibus" (Justice to all), the words "Taxation Without Representation" were added to DC license plates in 2000 and there is a current movement to the add the words "[[No Taxation Without Representation]]" to the DC flag.  Advocates of statehood who have supported these changes have said that they are intended as a protest and to raise awareness in the rest of the country.  These measures in particular were chosen because the DC flag is one of the few things under direct local control without requiring approval from Congress.

[[Image:DCFlag.PNG|thumbnail|right|300px|The flag of Washington, DC is based on the [[coat of arms]] borne by the [[England|English]] ancestors of [[George Washington]].]]

Various approaches for attaining voting representation in Congress have been proposed.
These include:
# Treating DC in some way as a state:
## Have Congress pass legislation that would treat DC as if it were a state for the purposes of voting representation in Congress. Senator Joseph Lieberman introduced The No Taxation Without Representation Act of 2003 (S. 617) on March 13, 2003, to the U.S. Senate, and Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton introduced the same Act in the U.S. House of Representatives (H.R. 1285).
## Amend the U.S. Constitution. In 1978 an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would have given full congressional voting representation to residents of the District of Columbia passed through both the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives. However, by 1985 when the seven year limit on ratification of the amendment expired, the amendment had only passed in 16 of 38 states necessary.
## Statehood for the District of Columbia. Statehood for DC was last discussed in the U.S. House of Representatives in November 1993, and was defeated by the vote of 277 to 153. 
# (Re)combining DC with Maryland in some way:
## Retrocession (Reunion with the State of Maryland).  The original land of DC was originally Maryland and Virginia's land, and from 1790 until 1801 citizens living in DC continued to vote for, and even run as, candidates for the U.S. Congress in Maryland or Virginia. In 1846 the land from Virginia was given back to Virginia, so all current DC land was originally from Maryland. If both the U.S. Congress and the Maryland state legislature agreed, DC land (except for federal land) could be given back to Maryland with only a small federal area.
## Treat District Residents as Maryland Voters for Federal Congressional Elections. Congress could give DC residents the right to vote as if they were part of Maryland for the Senate and House of Representatives (including the calculations for apportioning House seats).

On a local level, the city is run by an elected Mayor and City Council. The school board has both elected and appointed members. However, Congress has plenary power over the district. It has the right to review and overrule laws created locally, and has often done so.

DC residents pay all federal taxes, such as income tax, as well as local taxes. The Mayor and Council adopt a budget of local money with Congress reserving the right to make any changes. Because so much of the valuable property in the district is federally-owned and hence exempt from local property taxes, the city is frequently cash-strapped; public services in the city suffer as a result.

==History==
[[image:Karte_Washington_MKL1888.png|right|frame|[[1888]] [[Germany|German]] map of Washington, DC]]
Washington was selected as the site of the national capital city after a sitdown dinner deal between [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Alexander Hamilton]]. Jefferson agreed to support Hamilton's banking and federal bond plans in exchange for the choice of a Southern locale for the capital.  It was initially  100 [[square mile|mi&sup2;]] (260 [[square kilometer|km&sup2;]]).

The signing of the [[Residence Bill]] on [[July 16]], [[1790]] established a site along the [[Potomac River]] as the District of Columbia (seat of government) of the United States. Land for the district was given to the federal government by the states of [[Virginia]] and [[Maryland]] and the city was named after [[George Washington]]. On [[February 27]], [[1801]] the district was placed under the jurisdiction of the [[United States Congress]]. The towns of [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]] and [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] already existed at the time the district was founded; the remainder of the territory was subdivided into Washington City and Washington County (on the Maryland side of the Potomac) and [[Arlington County, Virginia#History|Alexandria County]] (on the Virginia side). In [[1871]], Georgetown, Washington City and [[Washington County, Washington, DC|Washington County]] were unified into Washington, DC.

By an act of Congress, the area south of the [[Potomac River|Potomac]] (39 [[square mile|mi&sup2;]] or about 100 [[square kilometer|km&sup2;]]) was returned to Virginia on [[July 9]], [[1846]] and now is incorporated into [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington County]] and a part of the City of Alexandria.  

On [[August 24]], [[1814]], British forces burnt the capital during the most notable destructive raid of the [[War of 1812]].  British forces burned public buildings including the White House, the Capitol, the Arsenal, the Dock-Yard, Treasury, War office, and the bridge across the Potomac.

President [[James Madison]] was forced to flee to Virginia and American morale was reduced to an all-time low. The expedition was carried out between August 19 and August 29, 1814, and was well organized and vigorously executed. On the 24th the American militia, who had collected at Bladensburg, Maryland, to protect the capital, fled almost before they were attacked. 

President [[Herbert Hoover]] ordered the [[United States Army]] on [[July 28]], [[1932]] to forcibly evict the "[[Bonus Army]]" of [[World War I]] veterans that gathered in Washington, DC to secure promised veteran's benefits early.  U.S. troops dispersed the last of the "Bonus Army" the next day.  

The [[Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution]] was ratified on [[March 29]], [[1961]] which allows residents of Washington, DC to vote for President (popular election) and have their votes count in the [[U.S. Electoral College|Electoral College]] the same as the least populous state, which currently is three (3).

The first 4.6  miles (7.4 kilometers) of the [[Washington Metro]] [[metro|subway]] system opened on [[March 27]], [[1976]].  

[[Walter Washington]] became the first elected mayor of the District in [[1974]]. During his third term, Mayor [[Marion Barry]] was arrested for [[drug]] use in an [[FBI]] sting on [[January 18]], [[1990]]. He was acquitted of felony charges, but convicted on one misdemeanor count of [[cocaine]] possession for which he served a six-month jail term. On [[January 2]], [[1991]] [[Sharon Pratt Kelly]] (elected as '''Sharon Pratt Dixon''' but married later that year) was sworn in as mayor of Washington, DC becoming the first black woman to lead a city of that size and importance in the United States.  After her term ended in [[1994]], Marion Barry was once again elected mayor for his fourth term. The current mayor, [[Anthony Williams]], a Yale educated lawyer, became mayor in [[1998]]. He was reelected in [[2002]]. See [[List of mayors of Washington, D.C.]]

The Washington area was the target of at least one of the four hijacked planes in the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].  One plane struck [[the Pentagon]] in Arlington County, killing 125 people in addition to the 64 aboard the plane, while another that was downed in a field in [[Pennsylvania]] is believed by many to have been intended to hit either the [[White House]] or the [[U.S. Capitol]].

Shortly after September 11, Washington was once more subject to fear from an [[2001 anthrax attack|anthrax attack]], when what may have been a domestic [[terrorist]] sent [[anthrax]]-contaminated mail to numerous members of Congress.  Thirty-one staff members were infected, and two [[U.S. Postal Service]] employees at a contaminated mail sorting facility at [[Brentwood, Washington, DC]], later died of pulmonary anthrax.

During three weeks of October [[2002]], [[John Allen Muhammad]] and [[Lee Boyd Malvo]] perpetrated what became known as the [[Beltway Sniper]] attacks in Washington and across the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area.  Muhammed and Malvo killed ten people and critically injured three others with a high-powered rifle.  The apparently random selection of victims (crossing racial, gender, and socioeconomic categories) caused a general panic in the Washington area and led schools to cancel all outdoor activities.  Muhammed and Malvo were arrested on [[October 24]] at a highway rest stop. In March 2004, Muhammad was sentenced to death and Malvo to life imprisonment for the attacks. 

In November of [[2003]], the toxin [[ricin]] was found in the mailroom of the White House, and in February of [[2004]], in the mailroom of U.S. Senate Majority Leader [[Bill Frist]].  As with the earlier anthrax attacks, no arrests have been made.

Partly in response to these events from the past few years, the Washington area has taken many steps to increase security.  Screening devices for biological agents, [[metal detector]]s, and vehicle barriers are now much more commonplace at office buildings as well as government buildings.  After the [[March 11, 2004 Madrid attacks|2004 Madrid train bombings]], local authorities have decided to test explosives detectors on the vulnerable [[Washington Metro]] subway system.  False alarms due to suspicious chemical or powder substances or suspected explosives have led to fairly frequent evacuations of buildings, Metro stations, and local post offices.  Vehicle inspections at several roadblocks set up around the [[U.S. Capitol]] building were introduced in July, 2004.

== Geography ==
[[Image:Dc satellite image.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Color-enhanced [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] satellite image of Washington, DC, taken April 26, 2002.  The [[Potomac River]] and its eastern branch, the [[Anacostia River]], are visible.  [[Virginia]] lies across the Potomac from Washington, while [[Maryland]] surrounds it on all other sides.  The black "crosshairs" in the image mark the quadrant divisions of Washington, with the [[U.S. Capitol]] at the center of the dividing lines.  To the west of the Capitol extends the [[National Mall]], visible as a slight green band in the image.  [[The Pentagon]] is also visible in Virginia, near the Potomac.]]
Washington is located at 38&deg;54'49" North, 77&deg;0'48" West (38.913611, -77.013222)[[Geographic references|<sup>1</sup>]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 177.0 [[square kilometer|km&sup2;]] (68.3 [[square mile|mi&sup2;]]).  159.0 km&sup2; (61.4 mi&sup2;) of it is land and 18.0 km&sup2; (6.9 mi&sup2;) of it is water.  The total area is 10.16% water.

Washington is surrounded by the [[U.S. State|state]]s of [[Virginia]] (on its southwest side, and a small part of its northwest one) and [[Maryland]] (on its southeast and northeast sides, and most of its northwest one); it interrupts those states' common border, which is the Potomac River both upstream and downstream from the District.  The city contains the historic '''federal city''', the territory of which was formerly part of those two adjacent states before they respectively ceded it for the national capital.  The land ceded from Virginia was returned by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in [[1847]], so what remains of the modern District was all once part of Maryland.

===City layout===

The original street layout was designed by [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant]] at the time of the city's founding. Washington is divided into four quadrants, directly along the four compass directions: [[Washington DC (northwest)|Northwest]], [[Washington DC (southwest)|Southwest]], [[Washington DC (northeast)|Northeast]], and [[Washington DC (southeast)|Southeast]].  Every street name has appended to it the abbreviation of the quadrant that it is in&mdash;e.g., Connecticut Ave., NW, New York Ave., NE.  A street's quadrant is necessary to include in postal addresses, especially because much of the city's street layout repeats within each quadrant.  The north-to-south numbered streets in Washington and count upwards from east to west in NW/SW (1st St NW, 2nd St NW, 3rd St NW, etc.); these streets repeat in NE/SE, counting upwards from west to the east.  The east-to-west lettered streets (A St, B St, etc.) "count" upwards from south to north in NW/NE, and likewise repeat in the opposite direction in SW/SE.  Street numbers count upwards traveling outward from the dividing lines of the quadrants.

The center of the north/south and east/west dividing lines is the [[U.S. Capitol]], which is offset from the physical center of Washington's diamond shape making the quadrants unequal in size.  Additionally, much of what was SW is now Arlington County, Virginia (or the Potomac River), making it by far the smallest quadrant; NW is the largest.

L'Enfant's plan also includes many diagonal avenues named after the states, such as [[Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington D.C.|Pennsylvania Avenue]] which connects the Capitol and the White House.

Washington is home to several professional sports teams: the [[Major League Soccer|MLS]] [[D.C. United]], the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] [[Washington Capitals]], the [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]] [[Washington Mystics]], the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] [[Washington Wizards]], and a as-of-yet-unnamed [[Washington D.C. Major League Baseball Franchise]] (the former [[Montreal Expos]], who will start play in [[2005]]). It also hosts the annual Legg Masson Tennis Classic [[tennis]] tournament.

Other professional and semi-professional teams based in DC include the [[Australian Rules Football|USAFL]] Baltimore Washington Eagles, the [[National Women's Football Association|NWFA]] D.C. Divas, the Minor League Football DC Explosion, and the [[cricket|Washington Cricket League]]. It was also home to the [[Women's United Soccer Association|WUSA]] [[Washington Freedom]], and, during the [[2000]]&ndash;[[2002]] [[National Lacrosse League|NLL]] seasons, the [[Washington Power]] was based in the city.

The [[National Football League|NFL]] [[Washington Redskins]] formerly played at R.F.K. Stadium in the District, but are now based at FedEx Field in [[Landover, Maryland]].

There were two [[Major League Baseball]] teams named the [[Washington Senators]] in the early and mid-[[20th century|20<sup>th</sup> century]], which left to become respectively the [[Minnesota Twins]] and the [[Texas Rangers]].  In the [[Washington_Senators#Premodern_baseball_in_Washington|premodern era of baseball]], the town was home to teams called the Washington Nationals, Washington Statesmen, and Washington Senators on and off from the [[1870s]] to the turn of the century. It was also home to several [[Negro League baseball|Negro League]] teams, including the [[Homestead Grays]], Washington Black Senators, Washington Elite Giants, Washington Pilots, and Washington Potomacs.  On [[September 29]], [[2004]] MLB announced plans to relocate the [[Montreal Expos]] to Washington, pending certain conditions including approval by the City Council of a stadium deal. The market is also home to many fans of the [[Baltimore Orioles]] of [[Baltimore, Maryland]], whose owner initially opposed the move of the Expos to DC.

The [[MCI Center]] in [[Chinatown]], home to the Capitals, Mystics, Wizards, and the Georgetown Hoyas, is also a major venue for concerts, [[WWE]] [[professional wrestling]], and other events.

The [[Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]] hosts the [[National Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Washington Opera]], the [[Washington Ballet]], and other musical and stage performances.  Notable local music clubs include Madam's Organ Blues Bar in Adams Morgan, and [[the Black Cat]], [[the 9:30 Club]], and the historic [[Bohemian Caverns]] jazz club, all in the U Street NW area.

Washington was an important center in the genesis of [[punk rock]] in the United States.  Punk bands of note from Washington include [[Fugazi]], [[Bad Brains]], and [[Minor Threat]].  Native Washingtonians continue to support punk bands, long after the punk movement's peak in popularity.  The region also has a storied [[indie rock]] history and was home to [[TeenBeat Records|TeenBeat]] and [[Simple Machines Records|Simple Machines]], among other indie record labels.

== Transportation ==

The [[I-495]] Beltway surrounds the Washington area.  The [[I-270]] spur connects I-495 with [[I-70]].  The [[I-395]] spur breaks off of [[I-95]] at the Beltway to connect northern Virginia with downtown Washington. [[I-66]] connects to [[I-495]] and provides access to the western edges of northern Virginia, and continues out to the west.

The Washington area is serviced by the [[Washington Metro]] public transportation system, which operates public buses and the region's subway system.

=== Airports ===
Washington is located in proximity to three airports:  [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] (IAD) between [[Dulles, Virginia]] and [[Chantilly, Virginia]]; [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport]] (DCA) in Arlington County; and [[Baltimore/Washington International Airport]] (BWI) near [[Baltimore, Maryland]].

[[Washington Dulles International Airport|Dulles International]] is used for most international travel to and from DC, and is the largest domestic [[low-cost carrier|low-cost]] hub in the US. [[Baltimore/Washington International Airport|Baltimore/Washington]] is used more for international and domestic service serving the Baltimore PMSA.
