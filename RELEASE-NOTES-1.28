== MediaWiki 1.28 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.28 is an alpha-quality branch and is not recommended for use in
production.

=== Configuration changes in 1.28 ===
* BREAKING CHANGE: $wgHTTPProxy is now *required* for all external requests
  made by MediaWiki via a proxy. Relying on the http_proxy environment
  variable is no longer supported.
* The load.php entry point now enforces the existing policy of not allowing
  access to session data, which includes the session user and the session
  user's language. If such access is attempted, an exception will be thrown.
* The number of internal PBKDF2 iterations used to derive the session secret
  is configurable via $wgSessionPbkdf2Iterations.
* Upload dialog's file upload log comment can now be configured separately for
  local and foreign uploads.
* $wgForeignUploadTargets now defaults to `[ 'local' ]`, where `'local'`
  signifies local uploads. A value of `[]` (empty array) now means that
  no upload targets are allowed, effectively disabling the upload dialog.
* The deprecated $wgEditEncoding variable has been removed; it was only used
  for Esperanto language character conversion. You are now recommended to use
  input methods provided by the UniversalLanguageSelector extension.
* When $wgPingback is true, MediaWiki will periodically ping
  https://www.mediawiki.org/beacon with basic information about the local
  MediaWiki installation.  This data includes, for example, the type of system,
  PHP version, and chosen database backend. This behavior is off by default.

=== New features in 1.28 ===
* User::isBot() method for checking if an account is a bot role account.
* Added a new 'slideshow' mode for galleries.
* Added a new hook, 'UserIsBot', to aid in determining if a user is a bot.
* Added a new hook, 'ApiMakeParserOptions', to allow extensions to better
  interact with API parsing.
* Added a new hook, 'UploadVerifyUpload', which can be used to reject a file
  upload. Unlike 'UploadVerifyFile' it provides information about upload comment
  and the file description page, but does not run for uploads to stash.

=== External library changes in 1.28 ===

==== Upgraded external libraries ====
* Updated es5-shim from v4.1.5 to v4.5.8

=== Action API internal changes in 1.28 ===

  interact with ApiParse and ApiExpandTemplates.

=== Languages updated in 1.28 ===

MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated
regularly. Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as
changes to languages because of Phabricator reports.

* (T137411) ban (Balinese), thanks to translators Adi Mayndra, Andru,
  BASAbali, M. Adiputra, Naval Scene, Nemo bis, NoiX180, and 아라.
* (T135867) shn (Shan), thanks to translators Khun Sar, Piangpha,
  Saiddzone Saimawnkham, Saosukham, and Sengwan.

=== Other changes in 1.28 ===
* (T128697) Improved handling of large diffs.
* [BREAKING CHANGE] $wgExtendedLoginCookies has been removed.  You can
  use or update a custom session provider if needed.
* Deprecated APIEditBeforeSave hook in favor of EditFilterMergedContent.
* The 'UploadVerification' hook is deprecated. Use 'UploadVerifyFile' instead.
* SiteConfiguration::isLocalVHost() was removed (deprecated since 1.25).
* The 'UserLoginComplete' hook has a new parameter to differentiate between actual
  login and visiting the login page while already logged in.
* ResourceLoader::makeLoaderURL() was removed (deprecated since 1.24).

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.28 requires PHP 5.5.9 or later. There is experimental support for
HHVM 3.6.5 or later.

MySQL is the recommended DBMS. PostgreSQL or SQLite can also be used, but
support for them is somewhat less mature. There is experimental support for
Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server.

The supported versions are:

* MySQL 5.0.3 or later
* PostgreSQL 8.3 or later
* SQLite 3.3.7 or later
* Oracle 9.0.1 or later
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 (9.00.1399)

== Upgrading ==

1.28 has several database changes since 1.27, and will not work without schema
updates. Note that due to changes to some very large tables like the revision
table, the schema update may take quite long (minutes on a medium sized site,
many hours on a large site).

If upgrading from before 1.11, and you are using a wiki as a commons
repository, make sure that it is updated as well. Otherwise, errors may arise
due to database schema changes.

If upgrading from before 1.7, you may want to run refreshLinks.php to ensure
new database fields are filled with data.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, you should upgrade to
1.5 first. The upgrade script maintenance/upgrade1_5.php has been removed
with MediaWiki 1.21.

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.

For notes on 1.27.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

== Mailing list ==

A mailing list is available for MediaWiki user support and discussion:

       https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-l

A low-traffic announcements-only list is also available:

       https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-announce

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.
