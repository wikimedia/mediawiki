== MediaWiki 1.28 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.28 is an alpha-quality branch and is not recommended for use in
production.

=== Configuration changes in 1.28 ===
* BREAKING CHANGE: $wgHTTPProxy is now *required* for all external requests
  made by MediaWiki via a proxy. Relying on the http_proxy environment
  variable is no longer supported.
* The load.php entry point now enforces the existing policy of not allowing
  access to session data, which includes the session user and the session
  user's language. If such access is attempted, an exception will be thrown.
* The number of internal PBKDF2 iterations used to derive the session secret
  is configurable via $wgSessionPbkdf2Iterations.
* Upload dialog's file upload log comment can now be configured separately for
  local and foreign uploads.
* $wgForeignUploadTargets now defaults to `[ 'local' ]`, where `'local'`
  signifies local uploads. A value of `[]` (empty array) now means that
  no upload targets are allowed, effectively disabling the upload dialog.
* The deprecated $wgEditEncoding variable has been removed; it was only used
  for Esperanto language character conversion. You are now recommended to use
  input methods provided by the UniversalLanguageSelector extension.
* When $wgPingback is true, MediaWiki will periodically ping
  https://www.mediawiki.org/beacon with basic information about the local
  MediaWiki installation.  This data includes, for example, the type of system,
  PHP version, and chosen database backend. This behavior is off by default.

=== New features in 1.28 ===
* User::isBot() method for checking if an account is a bot role account.
* Added a new 'slideshow' mode for galleries.
* Added a new hook, 'UserIsBot', to aid in determining if a user is a bot.
* Added a new hook, 'ApiMakeParserOptions', to allow extensions to better
  interact with API parsing.
* Added a new hook, 'UploadVerifyUpload', which can be used to reject a file
  upload. Unlike 'UploadVerifyFile' it provides information about upload comment
  and the file description page, but does not run for uploads to stash.
* (T141604) Extensions can now provide a better error message when their
  maintenance scripts are run without the extension being installed.
* (T8948) Numeric sorting in categories is now supported by setting $wgCategoryCollation
  to uca-default-u-kn or uca-<langcode>-u-kn. If migrating from another
  collation, you will need to run the updateCollation.php maintenance script.

=== External library changes in 1.28 ===

==== Upgraded external libraries ====
* Updated es5-shim from v4.1.5 to v4.5.8

==== New external libraries ====

==== Removed and replaced external libraries ====

=== Bug fixes in 1.28 ===

=== Action API changes in 1.28 ===
* Added 'maxarticlesize' property to action=query&meta=siteinfo which contains
  the value of $wgMaxArticleSize.
* Property 'modulemessages' from action=parse&prop=modules was removed
  (deprecated since 1.26).
* The following response properties from action=login, deprecated in 1.27, are
  now removed: lgtoken, cookieprefix, sessionid. Clients should handle cookies
  to properly manage session state.
* Submitting the lgtoken and lgpassword parameters in the query string to
  action=login is now deprecated and outputs a warning. They should be submitted
  in the POST body instead.
* Submitting sensitive authentication request parameters to action=clientlogin,
  action=createaccount, action=linkaccount, and action=changeauthenticationdata
  in the query string is now deprecated and outputs a warning. They should be
  submitted in the POST body instead.

=== Action API internal changes in 1.28 ===
* Added a new hook, 'ApiMakeParserOptions', to allow extensions to better
  interact with ApiParse and ApiExpandTemplates.

=== Languages updated in 1.28 ===

MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated
regularly. Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as
changes to languages because of Phabricator reports.

* (T137411) ban (Balinese), thanks to translators Adi Mayndra, Andru,
  BASAbali, M. Adiputra, Naval Scene, Nemo bis, NoiX180, and 아라.
* (T135867) shn (Shan), thanks to translators Khun Sar, Piangpha,
  Saiddzone Saimawnkham, Saosukham, and Sengwan.
* Czech (cs) and Slovak (sk) set as reciprocal fallbacks

=== Other changes in 1.28 ===
* (T128697) Improved handling of large diffs.
* [BREAKING CHANGE] $wgExtendedLoginCookies has been removed.  You can
  use or update a custom session provider if needed.
* Deprecated APIEditBeforeSave hook in favor of EditFilterMergedContent.
* The 'UploadVerification' hook is deprecated. Use 'UploadVerifyFile' instead.
* SiteConfiguration::isLocalVHost() was removed (deprecated since 1.25).
* The 'UserLoginComplete' hook has a new parameter to differentiate between actual
  login and visiting the login page while already logged in.
* ResourceLoader::makeLoaderURL() was removed (deprecated since 1.24).
* $.fn.liveAndTestAtStart was removed (deprecated since 1.24).
* Linker::link() and Linker::linkKnown() were deprecated; please instead use
  MediaWiki\Linker\LinkRenderer. In addition, the LinkBegin and LinkEnd hooks
  were replaced by HtmlPageLinkRendererBegin and HtmlPageLinkRendererEnd
  respectively. See docs/hooks.txt for the specific changes needed for those hooks.
* Aliases for Linker methods, deprecated since 1.21, were removed from Skin:
  * Skin::commentBlock() (use Linker::commentBlock() instead)
  * Skin::generateRollback() (use Linker::generateRollback() instead)
  * Skin::link() (use MediaWiki\Linker\LinkRenderer instead)
  * Skin::linkKnown() (use MediaWiki\Linker\LinkRenderer instead)
  * Skin::userLink() (use Linker::userLink() instead)
  * Skin::userToolLinks() (use Linker::userToolLinks() instead)
* The 'ParserLimitReportFormat' hook was removed.
* Disabled "bug 2702" HTML tidying of parsed UI messages on wikis where Tidy is
  disabled.
* DifferenceEngine::generateDiffBody() was removed (deprecated since 1.21).
* UploadBase::stashFileGetKey() and UploadBase::stashSession() were deprecated.
  Use ...->stashFile()->getFileKey() instead.
* "Public domain" was removed as a wiki license option from the installer, in
  favour of CC-0.
* AuthenticationRequest::$required is now changed from REQUIRED to PRIMARY_REQUIRED
  on requests needed by primary providers even if all primaries need them.
  Primary providers are discouraged from returning multiple REQUIRED requests.

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.28 requires PHP 5.5.9 or later. There is experimental support for
HHVM 3.6.5 or later.

MySQL is the recommended DBMS. PostgreSQL or SQLite can also be used, but
support for them is somewhat less mature. There is experimental support for
Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server.

The supported versions are:

* MySQL 5.0.3 or later
* PostgreSQL 8.3 or later
* SQLite 3.3.7 or later
* Oracle 9.0.1 or later
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 (9.00.1399)

== Upgrading ==

1.28 has several database changes since 1.27, and will not work without schema
updates. Note that due to changes to some very large tables like the revision
table, the schema update may take quite long (minutes on a medium sized site,
many hours on a large site).

If upgrading from before 1.11, and you are using a wiki as a commons
repository, make sure that it is updated as well. Otherwise, errors may arise
due to database schema changes.

If upgrading from before 1.7, you may want to run refreshLinks.php to ensure
new database fields are filled with data.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, you should upgrade to
1.5 first. The upgrade script maintenance/upgrade1_5.php has been removed
with MediaWiki 1.21.

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.

For notes on 1.27.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.
