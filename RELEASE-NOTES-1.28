== MediaWiki 1.28 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.28 is an alpha-quality branch and is not recommended for use in
production.

=== Configuration changes in 1.28 ===
* The load.php entry point now enforces the existing policy of not allowing
  access to session data, which includes the session user and the session
  user's language. If such access is attempted, an exception will be thrown.
* The number of internal PBKDF2 iterations used to derive the session secret
  is configurable via $wgSessionPbkdf2Iterations.
* Upload dialog's file upload log comment can now be configured separately for
  local and foreign uploads.
* $wgForeignUploadTargets now defaults to `[ 'local' ]`, where `'local'`
  signifies local uploads. A value of `[]` (empty array) now means that
  no upload targets are allowed, effectively disabling the upload dialog.

=== New features in 1.28 ===
* User::isBot() method for checking if an account is a bot role account.
* Added a new hook, 'UserIsBot', to aid in determining if a user is a bot.
* Added a new hook, 'ApiMakeParserOptions', to allow extensions to better
  interact with API parsing.

=== External library changes in 1.28 ===

==== Upgraded external libraries ====
* Updated es5-shim from v4.1.5 to v4.5.8

==== New external libraries ====

==== Removed and replaced external libraries ====

=== Action API internal changes in 1.28 ===
* Added a new hook, 'ApiMakeParserOptions', to allow extensions to better
  interact with ApiParse and ApiExpandTemplates.

=== Languages updated in 1.28 ===

MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated
regularly. Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as
changes to languages because of Phabricator reports.

* (T137411) ban (Balinese), thanks to translators Adi Mayndra, Andru,
  BASAbali, M. Adiputra, Naval Scene, Nemo bis, NoiX180, and 아라.

=== Other changes in 1.28 ===
* (T128697) Improved handling of large diffs.

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.28 requires PHP 5.5.9 or later. There is experimental support for
HHVM 3.6.5 or later.

MySQL is the recommended DBMS. PostgreSQL or SQLite can also be used, but
support for them is somewhat less mature. There is experimental support for
Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server.

The supported versions are:

* MySQL 5.0.3 or later
* PostgreSQL 8.3 or later
* SQLite 3.3.7 or later
* Oracle 9.0.1 or later
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 (9.00.1399)

== Upgrading ==

1.28 has several database changes since 1.27, and will not work without schema
updates. Note that due to changes to some very large tables like the revision
table, the schema update may take quite long (minutes on a medium sized site,
many hours on a large site).

If upgrading from before 1.11, and you are using a wiki as a commons
repository, make sure that it is updated as well. Otherwise, errors may arise
due to database schema changes.

If upgrading from before 1.7, you may want to run refreshLinks.php to ensure
new database fields are filled with data.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, you should upgrade to
1.5 first. The upgrade script maintenance/upgrade1_5.php has been removed
with MediaWiki 1.21.

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.

For notes on 1.27.x and older releases, see HISTORY.
