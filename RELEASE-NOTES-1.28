== MediaWiki 1.28 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.28 is an alpha-quality branch and is not recommended for use in
production.

=== Configuration changes in 1.28 ===
* The load.php entry point now enforces the existing policy of not allowing
  access to session data, which includes the session user and the session
  user's language. If such access is attempted, an exception will be thrown.
* Massive overhaul to authentication:
** AuthPlugin and AuthPluginUser are deprecated.
** LoginForm and associated templates are deprecated. Extensions which called
   static LoginForm methods should be converted into authentication providers.
** The following hooks are deprecated:
*** AbortAutoAccount (create a MediaWiki\Auth\PreAuthenticationProvider instead)
*** AbortLogin (create a MediaWiki\Auth\PreAuthenticationProvider instead)
*** AbortNewAccount (create a MediaWiki\Auth\PreAuthenticationProvider instead)
*** AddNewAccount (use LocalUserCreated instead)
*** AuthPluginSetup (create a MediaWiki\Auth\PrimaryAuthenticationProvider instead)
*** ChangePasswordForm (use AuthChangeFormFields instead, or security levels)
*** LoginUserMigrated (create a MediaWiki\Auth\PreAuthenticationProvider instead)
*** UserCreateForm (create a MediaWiki\Auth\AuthenticationProvider of some type instead)
*** UserLoginForm (create a MediaWiki\Auth\AuthenticationProvider of some type instead)
** The following hooks are removed:
*** AbortChangePassword
*** LoginPasswordResetMessage
*** PrefsPasswordAudit
** The UserLoginComplete hook will no longer be called for all logins, only for
   those via the web UI. Use UserLoggedIn if you need to do something on all
   logins.
** $wgRequirePasswordforEmailChange is removed.

=== New features in 1.28 ===
* MediaWiki\Auth infrastructure (called "AuthManager") allows for more flexible
  configuration of multiple authentication pieces that was possible with
  AuthPlugin. For example, it's now easy to plug in second-factor
  authentication, or add additional checks to the login process, or to support
  multiple login methods at once, or to support non-password-based login methods.
** Providers are configured via the global setting $wgAuthManagerConfig.
** A global, $wgDisableAuthManager, is temporarily available to disable
   AuthManager until extensions are ready to support it.
** New hook, AuthChangeFormFields, to adjust the form fields on
   AuthManager-related special pages.
** New hook, AuthManagerLoginAuthenticateAudit, for additional logging of
   AuthManager-related authentication requests.
** New hook, ChangeAuthenticationDataAudit, for additional logging of
   AuthManager-related authentication data changes.
** New hook, SecuritySensitiveOperationStatus, to work with the new mechanism
   for requiring a recent login before taking security-sensitive operations
   like changing a password.
** Two new globals, $wgChangeCredentialsBlacklist and $wgRemoveCredentialsBlacklist
   can be used to prevent the web UI and the API changing certain authentication data.

=== External library changes in 1.28 ===

==== Upgraded external libraries ====

=== Bug fixes in 1.28 ===


=== Action API changes in 1.28 ===
* Several changes when $wgDisableAuthManager is false:
** action=login is deprecated for uses other than bot passwords.
** list=users can now indicate if a missing username is creatable.
** action=createaccount is changed in a non-backwards-compatible manner.
** Added action=query&meta=authmanagerinfo.
** Added action=clientlogin to be used to log into the main account instead of
   action=login.
** Added action=linkaccount.
** Added action=unlinkaccount.
** Added action=changeauthenticationdata.
** Added action=removeauthenticationdata.
** Added action=resetpassword.

=== Action API internal changes in 1.28 ===
* ApiCreateAccount is deprecated, and will be removed soon.


=== Languages updated in 1.28 ===

MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated
regularly. Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as
changes to languages because of Phabricator reports.

=== Other changes in 1.28 ===
* User::addNewUserLogEntry() was deprecated.
* User::addNewUserLogEntryAutoCreate() was deprecated.
* User::isPasswordReminderThrottled() was deprecated.
* Bot-oriented parameters to Special:UserLogin (wpCookieCheck, wpSkipCookieCheck)
  were removed.


== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.28 requires PHP 5.5.9 or later. There is experimental support for
HHVM 3.6.5 or later.

MySQL is the recommended DBMS. PostgreSQL or SQLite can also be used, but
support for them is somewhat less mature. There is experimental support for
Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server.

The supported versions are:

* MySQL 5.0.3 or later
* PostgreSQL 8.3 or later
* SQLite 3.3.7 or later
* Oracle 9.0.1 or later
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 (9.00.1399)

== Upgrading ==

1.28 has several database changes since 1.27, and will not work without schema
updates. Note that due to changes to some very large tables like the revision
table, the schema update may take quite long (minutes on a medium sized site,
many hours on a large site).

If upgrading from before 1.11, and you are using a wiki as a commons
repository, make sure that it is updated as well. Otherwise, errors may arise
due to database schema changes.

If upgrading from before 1.7, you may want to run refreshLinks.php to ensure
new database fields are filled with data.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, you should upgrade to
1.5 first. The upgrade script maintenance/upgrade1_5.php has been removed
with MediaWiki 1.21.

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.

For notes on 1.27.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

== Online documentation ==

Documentation for both end-users and site administrators is available on
MediaWiki.org, and is covered under the GNU Free Documentation License (except
for pages that explicitly state that their contents are in the public domain):

       https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Documentation

== Mailing list ==

A mailing list is available for MediaWiki user support and discussion:

       https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-l

A low-traffic announcements-only list is also available:

       https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-announce

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.

== IRC help ==

There's usually someone online in #mediawiki on irc.freenode.net.
