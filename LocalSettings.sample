# Local settings work like this: the file LocalSettings.sample
# should be copied to LocalSettings.php in the source directory
# and edited for your local file system settings and software
# configuration preferences. The install script will copy it to
# the installation path, but a copy should also remain in the
# source tree so that maintenance scripts can refer to it (you
# may want to make it a symbolic link after installation).  Do
# not check LocalSettings.php into CVS!  It is different for
# every installation, and must not be overridden.

# The most important setting is here: $IP is the installation
# path for the software.
