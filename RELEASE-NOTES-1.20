=== Languages updated in 1.20 ===

MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated
regularly. Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as
changes to languages because of Bugzilla reports.

* Emilian (egl) added.
* Tornedalen Finnish (fit) added.
* Mizo (lus) added.
* Santali (sat) added.
* (bug 34192) Namespace gender aliases for Albanian languages (sq & aln).
* (bug 35541) Namespace gender aliases for Croatian (hr).
* (bug 36012) Space in $separatorTransformTable should be non-breaking in
  Portuguese, Esperanto and Udmurt.
* Turoyo (tru) added.
* Cyrillic-Latin language converter added for Uzbek (uz).

=== Other changes in 1.20 ===
* The user_token field is now left empty until a user attempts to login and
  cookies need to be set. It is also now possible to reset every user's
  user_token simply by clearing the values in the user_token column.
* Removed ./tests/qunit/index.html from core. It wasn't actively maintained and
  has been made obsolete when [[Special:JavaScriptTest/qunit]] was introduced,
  which actually uses ResourceLoader, LocalSettings and the Skin.
* Removed $wgDBtransactions global. This was only checked in one class
  and only applies to MyISAM or similar DBs. Those should only be used
  for archived sites anyway. We can't get edit conflicts on such sites,
  so the WikiPage code wasn't useful there either.
* Deprecated mw.user.name in favour of mw.user.getName.
* Deprecated mw.user.anonymous in favour of mw.user.isAnon.
* Deprecated DatabaseBase functions newFromParams(), newFromType(), set(),
  quote_ident(), and escapeLike() were removed.
* Use of __DIR__ instead of dirname( __FILE__ ).
* OutputPage::wrapWikiMsg() no longer supports the 'options' parameter. It was
  not used and complicated migration to Message class.
* Live preview functionality has been improved and moved into the
 'mediawiki.action.edit.preview' module. The old 'mediawiki.legacy.preview' module
  has been removed.
* (bug 40448) Removed mediawiki.legacy.mwsuggest module, and removed the
  following that has become obsolete:
  - globals $wgEnableMWSuggest and $wgMWSuggestTemplate.
  - mw.config.values wgMWSuggestTemplate and wgSearchNamespaces.
  - method SearchEngine::getMWSuggestTemplate().

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.20 requires PHP 5.3.2. PHP 4 is no longer supported.

MySQL is the recommended DBMS. PostgreSQL or SQLite can also be used, but
support for them is somewhat less mature. There is experimental support for IBM
DB2 and Oracle.

The supported versions are:

* MySQL 5.0.2 or later
* PostgreSQL 8.3 or later
* SQLite 3.3.7 or later
* Oracle 9.0.1 or later

== Upgrading ==

1.20 has several database changes since 1.19, and will not work without schema
updates.

If upgrading from before 1.11, and you are using a wiki as a commons
repository, make sure that it is updated as well. Otherwise, errors may arise
due to database schema changes.

If upgrading from before 1.7, you may want to run refreshLinks.php to ensure
new database fields are filled with data.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, some major database
changes are made, and there is a slightly higher chance that things could
break. Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.

For notes on 1.19.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

== Online documentation ==

== Mailing list ==

A mailing list is available for MediaWiki user support and discussion:

	https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-l

A low-traffic announcements-only list is also available:

	https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-announce

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.
