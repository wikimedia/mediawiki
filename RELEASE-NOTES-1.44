== MediaWiki 1.44.0-PRERELEASE ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.44 is an alpha-quality development branch, and is not recommended
for use in production.

== Upgrading notes for 1.44 ==
Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed per-version upgrade instructions from the
oldest supported upgrading version, MediaWiki 1.35.

Some specific notes for MediaWiki 1.44 upgrades are below:

* …

For notes on 1.43.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

=== Configuration changes for system administrators in 1.44 ===

* (T382987) The default value of 'http.dnsbl.sorbs.net.' in $wgDnsBlacklistUrls
  has been removed. This is because sorbs.net have stopped providing their
  services. This means that if you have $wgEnableDnsBlacklist set to true, it
  will no longer provide any value unless you add other servers to
  $wgDnsBlacklistUrls.
* Google search removed (T384678): If site search is disabled with
  $wgDisableTextSearch but $wgSearchForwardUrl is not set to a URL to which to
  forward searches, then MediaWiki used to show a Google search form. This has
  been removed, and instead a notice is displayed. System administrators should
  set e.g. $wgSearchForwardUrl = 'https://duckduckgo.com?q=$1' to avoid this.
* The 'exception-json' log channel has been removed. It previously provided
  structured exception data in a custom machine-readable format. Since
  MediaWiki 1.26, structured exception data conforming to the PSR-3 logging
  standard is also available on the 'exception' log channel.
  (Log channels can be configured using $wgMWLoggerDefaultSpi.)
* $wgUsersNotifiedOnAllChanges now requires the listed users to have confirmed
  email addresses, just like other kinds of email notifications do.
  You can confirm the email address by logging in as the user and using
  "Confirm your email address" in user preferences, or by running a maintenance
  script: resetUserEmail.php --no-reset-password <username> <new-email>
* …

==== New configuration ====

* (T377829) $wgAutopromoteOnceRCExcludedGroups - Defaults to an empty list, can
  be used to define a denylist of user group names. One-shot autopromotions
  into these groups will never result in an RC entry, even if
  $wgAutopromoteOnceLogInRC is true, as long as they were the only new groups
  the user was autopromoted into.
* (T240542) $wgAutoblockExemptions - IP addresses and CIDR ranges listed here
  will not be affected by autoblocks, similar to
  MediaWiki:Block-autoblock-exemptionlist. Defaults to an empty list.
* …

==== Changed configuration ====

* (T13555) $wgParserEnableLegacyHeadingDOM now defaults to `false`.
  You can set it to `true` to temporarily restore the legacy HTML markup
  for wikitext headings in the output from the Parser, in case you find
  that your wiki's content or an extension is incompatible with the new markup.
  More information: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Heading_HTML_changes
  This option will be removed in a future release.
* (T386210) $wgAddGroups and $wgRemoveGroups now use the correct merge strategy
  of `array_merge_recursive`. This lets extensions add entries from the
  extension.json file, which would previously be silently ignored.
* (T382987) $wgDnsBlacklistUrls now defaults to an empty array. See the comment
  in the "Configuration changes for system administrators" section above.
* (T387856) $wgEnotifImpersonal and $wgEnotifMaxRecips are now deprecated.

==== Removed configuration ====

* wgResourceLoaderUseObjectCacheForDeps, deprecated in 1.43, has been removed.
  It is now always enabled (T343492).
* wgBaseDirectory, unused, has been removed in favour of MW_INSTALL_PATH.
  If a variable value is needed, inject an optional parameter instead.
* …

=== New user-facing features in 1.44 ===

* (T363538, T204792) New parser functions {{#interlanguagelink:prefix|title}}
  and {{#interwikilink:prefix|title|caption}} to unambiguously create
  interlanguage and interwiki links, respectively, even when the "prefix"
  might conflict with a namespace on the local wiki.
* (T326057) Attempting to create a redirect to a nonexistent page will now
  result in a warning.
* (T33951) The Interwiki extension has been moved to MediaWiki core. It is now
  possible to view and edit the interwiki table without installing an extension.
  $wgInterwikiCentralDB and $wgInterwikiCentralInterlanguageDB have been
  removed, use $wgVirtualDomainsMapping['virtual-interwiki'] and
  $wgVirtualDomainsMapping['virtual-interwiki-interlanguage'] instead.
  $wgInterwikiViewOnly has been removed, (un)assign "interwiki" right instead.
* (T302140) Rollbacked edits are marked as manually patrolled instead of
  auto-patrolled since the rollback action was a manual patrol of the edit.
* (T56145) Introduces a new tag 'mw-recreated' to note edits which create pages
 that have been previously deleted by having an associated deletion log entry.
 This does not consider deletion log entries that were suppressed.
* (T326056) Attempting to create a redirect to another redirect will now
  result in a warning.
* (T322944) Developers using the Action API can now use the new crossorigin=
  parameter. If used with a supported session provider, such as OAuth,
  this permits authenticated cross-origin requests against the Action API,
  similar to how origin=* allows unauthenticated cross-origin requests.
* (T24521, T62109) Embedding a file (e.g., [[File:MediaWiki.png]]) on a page
  protected with cascading protection will no longer restrict edits to the
  file description page, only file uploads. Transcluding a file description
  page (e.g., {{:File:MediaWiki.png}}) will now restrict edits to the page.
* …

=== New features for sysadmins in 1.44 ===

* (T267477) Users with rename userright can now rename themselves through
  [[Special:RenameUser]].
* (T104830) [[Special:RenameUser]] can now be used in wiki families using
  shared tables.
  A renameuser-global right is added and required when renaming global users.
  No groups have this right by default.
* (T310051) uppercase-ckb collation added. uca-xx-ckb collation deprecated
* …

=== New developer features in 1.44 ===

* The AuthenticationAttemptThrottled hook was added.
* The CodexTablePager class was added.
* UserFactory now has newFromNameOrIp() method to quickly create a User object
  for either an IP or a named user.
* The ApiQueryCheckCanExecute hook was added.
* The ChangesListInsertLogEntry hook was added.
* The TempUserDetailsLookup service was added.
* The UserLinkRenderer service was added.
* The AuthPreserveQueryParams hook has a new option, $options['request'],
  to avoid having to rely on the global context.
* You can use LoggerFactory::getContext() to add extra context to all PSR-3
  log events.
* New helper methods Html::addClass() and Html::expandClassList().
* …

=== Breaking changes in 1.44 ===

* In StatusValue::replaceMessage(), ::hasMessage() and ::hasMessagesExcept()
  passing MessageSpecifier or MessageValue as $source, deprecated in 1.43,
  is no longer allowed.
* StatusValue will no longer accept errors given as a MessageSpecifier
  combined with a parameters array. This was deprecated in 1.43.
* The methods MessageValue::objectParams(), Message::objectParams()
  and Message::objectParam(), deprecated in 1.43, have been removed.
* The UserGroupMembershipParam class, deprecated in 1.43, has been removed.
* The ParamType::OBJECT constant, deprecated in 1.43, has been removed.
* The MediaWiki\Message\Converter class, deprecated in 1.43, has been removed.
  Use MessageValue::newFromSpecifier or Message::newFromSpecifier
  instead (T358779).
* Public access to OutputPage::mModules and OutputPage::mModuleStyles,
  deprecated in 1.38, has been removed.
* Return type declarations were added to methods in `includes/libs/Message`,
  specifically in the `MessageSpecifier`, `ITextFormatter`, and
  `IMessageFormatterFactory` interfaces. This update enhances type safety but
  may require updates in any classes implementing these interfaces, including
  external extensions. Extensions such as Translate, Flow, and ReadingLists
  require compatibility patches to support these changes.
* EditPage::internalAttemptSave(), deprecated since 1.43, was removed.
* IDatabase::LB_TRX_ROUND_ID was removed and IDatabase::LB_READ_ONLY_REASON
  was marked as an internal constant.
* IDatabase::onAtomicSectionCancel() has been removed without deprecation
  as it's completely unused.
* ISQLPlatform::tableNames(), deprecated since 1.39, has been removed.
* The Wikimedia\LightweightObjectStore\ExpirationAwareness interface is now
  considered internal. Use BagOStuff to access TTL constants instead.
* The ParsoidOutputAccess class marked @unstable from creation and
  deprecated with all of its methods in 1.43, has been removed.
* (T382030) MediaWiki core database schema and schema changes have been moved
  to a new top-level sql/ directory. This should only affect code directly
  referencing the old paths.
* The HtmlToContentTransform::setMetrics() and
  HtmlInputTransformHelper::setMetrics() methods now require a StatsFactory
  argument.  Passing a StatsdDataFactoryInterface was deprecated in 1.43.
* The method ParserOptions::setupFakeRevision has been marked internal. It
  will remain backwards compatible in 1.44 but may change without notice in
  1.45 or later.
* The Less mixin .column-break-after-avoid(), deprecated in 1.43, has been
  removed. Use just the CSS rule `break-after: avoid-column;` instead now.
* ApiBase::errorArrayToStatus(), deprecated in 1.43, has been removed.
* ZipDirectoryReader has been moved to the Wikimedia\Mime library.
  No callers outside that library are known.
* The constant UploadBase::OVERWRITE_EXISTING_FILE has been removed, it has
  been unused as a status code by UploadBase for more than 14 years.
* The constant UploadBase::HOOK_ABORTED has been removed, unused since 1.34.
* MediaWikiIntegrationTestCase::$tablesUsed, deprecated since 1.41, has been
  removed. The framework detects changed tables since 1.41 automatically.
* MediaWiki\Language\Language class no longer supports manually calling the
  constructor, use LanguageFactory instead.
* The MediaWiki\Config\MutableConfig interface now extends
  MediaWiki\Config\Config. Implementing MutableConfig without implementing
  Config is no longer possible.
* HTMLForm methods getPreText, setPreText, addPreText, getPostText,
  setPostText, addPostText, getHeaderText, setHeaderText, addHeaderText,
  getFooterText, setFooterText and addFooterText, deprecated since 1.38, have
  been removed.
* FormSpecialPage methods preText and postText, deprecated since 1.38, have
  been removed.
* The `MediaWiki\User\Registration\IUserRegistrationProvider` interface now
  defines a required fetchRegistrationBatch() method.
* BagOStuff::clearLastError() and WANObjectCache::clearLastError(), both
  deprecated in 1.43, have been removed.
* The hook OutputPageMakeCategoryLinks, deprecated in 1.43, has been removed.
* ApiPageSet::getTitles(), ApiPageSet::getGoodTitles(),
  ApiPageSet::getMissingTitles(), ApiPageSet::getGoodAndMissingTitles(),
  ApiPageSet::getRedirectTitles() and ApiPageSet::getSpecialTitles, deprecated
  since 1.37, have been removed.
* The methods Skin::getFooterIcons and ::makeFooterIcon are final and
  overriding is no longer supported.
* PageArchive::undeleteAsUser, deprecated since 1.35, has been removed.
* DatabaseBlock::getQueryInfo and ::getRangeCond, deprecated since 1.43, have
  been removed.
* wfGetDB(), deprecated in 1.39, has been removed.
* The IDatabase transaction lifecycle callbacks onTransactionResolution(),
  onTransactionPreCommitOrIdle() and onTransactionCommitOrIdle() no longer
  receive a DB connection handle as an argument. (T386190)
* The $schema parameters to DatabaseBlockStore::getQueryInfo() and
  ::getRangeCond() have been removed. They were documented as temporary
  migration support parameters. Support for ipb_* field aliases in
  DatabaseBlockStore::newFromRow(), which was meant to support the use of
  $schema, has been removed.

* WANObjectCache::clearLastError(), deprecated in 1.38 & emitting notices since
  1.43, has been removed.

  is no longer supported. Use StatsFactory instead.
* When fetching a message containing {{PAGENAME}} or similar with
  wfMessage(...)->text(), the title used will be Special:Badtitle unless a
  context title was set with e.g. Message::setContext(). In the past, the title

* MediaWikiTitleCodec has been split. TitleParser and TitleFormatter are now
  classes rather than interfaces. Remove all references to MediaWikiTitleCodec.
* A new abstract method, CentralIdLookup::lookupUserNamesWithFilter(), was
  added. This is a breaking change for extensions that extend this class.
* UserOptionsStore::fetchBatchForUserNames() was added. This is a breaking
  change for extensions that implement the interface.
* Callbacks registered by MessageCacheFetchOverrides handlers will now be
  called with only two parameters. The $language and $useDB parameter will not
  be passed.
* The following formerly-public properties of OutputPage, deprecated with
  warnings in 1.38, have been removed:
   - OutputPage::$mNoGallery
   - OutputPage::$mRevisionTimestamp
* OutputPage::formatPermissionsErrorMessage(), deprecated since 1.36, has been
  removed. Use formatPermissionStatus() instead.
* BaseTemplate::getFooterIcons(), deprecated since 1.35, has been removed.
* The method signatures of EmailNotification::notifyOnPageChange()
  and actuallyNotifyOnPageChange() have changed. These method are now
  marked as @internal and must not be used by extensions.
* The modules codex-search-styles and @wikimedia/codex-search have been
  removed. Please use MediaWiki\\ResourceLoader\\CodexModule instead.
* …

=== Deprecations in 1.44 ===

* Various static methods on ChangeTags, deprecated since 1.41, each now emit
  deprecation warnings. Use service access to the ChangeTagsStore instead:
  addTags(), defineTag(), deleteTagEverywhere(), getDisplayTableName(),
  getSoftwareTags(), getTags(), getTagsWithData(), listDefinedTags(),
  listExplicitlyDefinedTags(), listSoftwareActivatedTags(),
  listSoftwareDefinedTags(), makeTagSummarySubquery(), modifyDisplayQuery(),
  purgeTagCacheAll(), tagUsageStatistics(), and updateTags().
* EditPage::$textbox2 has been deprecated (once again).
* EditPage::$action, deprecated since 1.38, now emits deprecation warnings.
* (T166010) All PHP code in MediaWiki is slowly being moved to be in a class
  namespace as appropriate, so that we can use PSR-4 auto-loading, which will
  speed up general code loading of MediaWiki. The old global namespace class
  names are being left behind as deprecated aliases.

* IDatabase::setTransactionListener() is now deprecated without replacement.
* ILBFactory::setWaitForReplicationListener() is now deprecated without
  replacement.
* Maintenance::beginTransaction(), Maintenance::commitTransaction(),
  Maintenance::rollbackTransaction(), and Maintenance::waitForReplication()
  are now deprecated. Use Maintenance::*TransactionRound() instead.

* OutputPage::parserOptions() has been deprecated; use
  ParserOptions::newFromContext( $outputPage->getContext() ) instead.
* OutputPage::wrapWikiTextAsInterface() with an empty string as $wrapperClass
  has been deprecated; this didn't work correctly in the first place.
* LinksUpdate::getImages() has been deprecated, like ParserOutput::getImages().
  Instead, use ParserOutput::getLinkList( ParserOutputLinkTypes::MEDIA ).
* ResourceLoader::makeConfigSetScript() is now deprecated. Consider using
  package files instead. Or, you can return "mw.config.set()" combined with
  RL\Context::encodeJson, if available. If not, use FormatJson::encode.
* wfAssembleUrl(), wfMatchesDomainList(), and wfUrlProtocolsWithoutProtRel(),
  all deprecated in 1.39, now emit warnings.
* BlockManager::getUserBlock(), deprecated since 1.42, now emits warnings.
* DatabaseBlock methods newFromRow(), delete(), insert(), update(),
  doAutoblock(), isExemptedFromAutoblocks(), doAutoblock(), updateTimestamp(),
  newFromTarget(), newListFromTarget() and getBlocksForIPList() are now
  deprecated and emit deprecation warnings. Use the corresponding method in
  DatabaseBlockStore, except for getBlocksForIPList() which is in BlockManager.
* User::whoIs() and ::whoIsReal(), deprecated since 1.43, now emit warnings.
* The parameter $default in WebRequest::getRawVal(), deprecated since 1.43,
  is now emitting warnings.
* The link to "Special pages" has moved from the toolbox to MediaWiki:Sidebar
  since toolbox relates to tools associated with the current page, not the
  site. To support the transition, for interface admins who have already
  customized MediaWiki:Sidebar, the special pages link will be automatically
  added. This will start emitting notices in the next MediaWiki release. More
  information is available at T333211. To avoid future breakage, see the
  guidance in T385346.

   - Xml::span() – use Html::element() instead
   - Xml::password() – use Html::input() instead

  replaced with `OutputPage::getMetadata()->{get,set}RevisionTimestamp()`
* The 'PermissionErrorAudit' hook has been deprecated and replaced by
  the 'PermissionStatusAudit' hook.
* The 'PageContentSave' hook, deprecated in 1.35, now emits deprecation warnings
  when used. Use the 'MultiContentSave' hook instead.

  use DifferenceEngine::authorizeView() instead.

  internal implementation details not intended for public use.
* MediaWikiTitleCodec::getTitleInvalidRegex() is now deprecated. Use the same
  method in TitleParser.
* The `moment` library is deprecated and consumers should explore using
  alternatives. More information and support will be provided at
  https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T146798
* Passing the wrong type or null as the various parameters to the public methods
  of SiteConfiguration is now deprecated:
  - SiteConfiguration::get

=== Other changes in 1.44 ===
* The ArticleProtect and ArticleProtectComplete hooks are now called when
  WikiPage::doUpdateRestrictions is called to protect a non-existing
  title.
* Introduce ISearchResultSet::isApproximateTotalHits() (defaults to false
  in BaseSearchResultSet) to let SearchEngine implementations run optimizations
  that might lead to innacurate computation of the exact number of pages
  matching the search query.
* (T367441) ResourceLoader Debug mode now defaults to debug mode v2. This means
  ?debug=true now maps to debug=2. Unlike debug mode v1, this doesn't load each
  file from disk, and your code looks the same as it is in production with
  closures that prevent global variable leakage.
