* …

For notes on 1.43.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

=== Configuration changes for system administrators in 1.44 ===

* …

==== New configuration ====

* (T377829) $wgAutopromoteOnceRCExcludedGroups - Defaults to an empty list, can
  be used to define a denylist of user group names. One-shot autopromotions
  into these groups will never result in an RC entry, even if
  $wgAutopromoteOnceLogInRC is true, as long as they were the only new groups
  the user was autopromoted into.
* …

==== Changed configuration ====

* (T13555) $wgParserEnableLegacyHeadingDOM now defaults to `false`.
  You can set it to `true` to temporarily restore the legacy HTML markup
  for wikitext headings in the output from the Parser, in case you find
  that your wiki's content or an extension is incompatible with the new markup.
  More information: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Heading_HTML_changes
  This option will be removed in a future release.

==== Removed configuration ====

* wgResourceLoaderUseObjectCacheForDeps, deprecated in 1.43, has been removed.
  It is now always enabled (T343492).
* wgBaseDirectory, unused, has been removed in favour of MW_INSTALL_PATH.
  If a variable value is needed, inject an optional parameter instead.
* …

=== New user-facing features in 1.44 ===

* (T363538, T204792) New parser functions {{#interlanguagelink:prefix|title}}
  and {{#interwikilink:prefix|title|caption}} to unambiguously create
  interlanguage and interwiki links, respectively, even when the "prefix"
  might conflict with a namespace on the local wiki.
* (T326057) Attempting to create a redirect to a nonexistent page will now
  result in a warning.
* (T33951) The Interwiki extension has been moved to MediaWiki core. It is now
  possible to view and edit the interwiki table without installing an extension.
  $wgInterwikiCentralDB and $wgInterwikiCentralInterlanguageDB have been
  removed, use $wgVirtualDomainsMapping['virtual-interwiki'] and
  $wgVirtualDomainsMapping['virtual-interwiki-interlanguage'] instead.
  $wgInterwikiViewOnly has been removed, (un)assign "interwiki" right instead.
* …

=== Languages updated in 1.44 ===
MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated regularly.
Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as changes to languages
because of Phabricator reports.

* (T379137) Added language support for Hunde (hke).

=== Breaking changes in 1.44 ===

* In StatusValue::replaceMessage(), ::hasMessage() and ::hasMessagesExcept()
  passing MessageSpecifier or MessageValue as $source, deprecated in 1.43,
  is no longer allowed.
* StatusValue will no longer accept errors given as a MessageSpecifier
  combined with a parameters array. This was deprecated in 1.43.
* The methods MessageValue::objectParams(), Message::objectParams()
  and Message::objectParam(), deprecated in 1.43, have been removed.
* The UserGroupMembershipParam class, deprecated in 1.43, has been removed.
* The ParamType::OBJECT constant, deprecated in 1.43, has been removed.
* The MediaWiki\Message\Converter class, deprecated in 1.43, has been removed.
  Use MessageValue::newFromSpecifier or Message::newFromSpecifier
  instead (T358779).
* Return type declarations were added to methods in `includes/libs/Message`,
  specifically in the `MessageSpecifier`, `ITextFormatter`, and
  `IMessageFormatterFactory` interfaces. This update enhances type safety but
  may require updates in any classes implementing these interfaces, including
  external extensions. Extensions such as Translate, Flow, and ReadingLists
  require compatibility patches to support these changes.
* IDatabase::LB_TRX_ROUND_ID was removed and IDatabase::LB_READ_ONLY_REASON
  was marked as an internal constant.
* The ParsoidOutputAccess class marked @unstable from creation and
  deprecated with all of its methods in 1.43, has been removed.
* (T382030) MediaWiki core database schema and schema changes have been moved
  to a new top-level sql/ directory. This should only affect code directly
  referencing the old paths.
* The HtmlToContentTransform::setMetrics() and
  HtmlInputTransformHelper::setMetrics() methods now require a StatsFactory
  argument.  Passing a StatsdDataFactoryInterface was deprecated in 1.43.
* IDatabase::onAtomicSectionCancel() has been removed without deprecation
  as it's completely unused.
* The method ParserOptions::setupFakeRevision has been marked internal. It
  will remain backwards compatible in 1.44 but may change without notice in
  1.45 or later.
* ISQLPlatform::tableNames(), deprecated since 1.39, has been removed.
* The Less mixin .column-break-after-avoid(), deprecated in 1.43, has been
  removed. Use just the CSS rule `break-after: avoid-column;` instead now.
* ApiBase::errorArrayToStatus(), deprecated in 1.43, has been removed.
* The MediaWiki\Config\MutableConfig interface now extends
  MediaWiki\Config\Config. Implementing MutableConfig without implementing
  Config is no longer possible.
* …

=== Deprecations in 1.44 ===

* Various static methods on ChangeTags, deprecated since 1.41, each now emit
  deprecation warnings. Use service access to the ChangeTagsStore instead:
  addTags(), defineTag(), deleteTagEverywhere(), getDisplayTableName(),
  getSoftwareTags(), getTags(), getTagsWithData(), listDefinedTags(),
  listExplicitlyDefinedTags(), listSoftwareActivatedTags(),
  listSoftwareDefinedTags(), makeTagSummarySubquery(), modifyDisplayQuery(),
  purgeTagCacheAll(), tagUsageStatistics(), and updateTags().
* WikiPage::doEditUpdates(), deprecated since 1.32, is now emitting warnings.
  Use DerivedPageDataUpdater::doUpdates() instead.
* Maintenance::beginTransaction(), Maintenance::commitTransaction(),
  Maintenance::rollbackTransaction(), and Maintenance::waitForReplication()
  are now deprecated. Use Maintenance::*TransactionRound() instead.
* The ReverseArrayIterator class, unused since 1.32, has been deprecated.
* LinksUpdate::getImages() has been deprecated, like ParserOutput::getImages().
  Instead, use ParserOutput::getLinkList( ParserOutputLinkTypes::MEDIA ).
* ...
* …

=== Other changes in 1.44 ===
* The ArticleProtect and ArticleProtectComplete hooks are now called when
  WikiPage::doUpdateRestrictions is called to protect a non-existing
  title.
* Introduce ISearchResultSet::isApproximateTotalHits() (defaults to false
  in BaseSearchResultSet) to let SearchEngine implementations run optimizations
  that might lead to innacurate computation of the exact number of pages
  matching the search query.
* …
