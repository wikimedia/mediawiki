= MediaWiki release notes =

Security reminder: MediaWiki does not require PHP's register_globals
setting since version 1.2.0. If you have it on, turn it *off* if you can.

** NOTE TO COMMITTERS: Before 1.5.0 release, rearrange these nicely
** and move 1.4 stuff to HISTORY.

== MediaWiki 1.5 ==

New exciting things! Need further work and testing...
* user groups/permissions scheme
* e-mail change notifications
* 'live preview' reduces preview reload burden on supported browsers
* ...and more!

Need to merge:
* SCHEMA_WORK
* stuff


== Version Enotif+Eauthent EN+EA v2.00/CVS, 14.12.2004 ==
written by Thomas Gries, Berlin and Markus Arndt, Munich

Executive summary for the impatient reader:

Enotif adds e-mail notification to MediaWiki and sends e-mails
to watching users when a watch-listed page or user_talk page is changed
http://bugzilla.wikipedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=454
Visit the complete documentation on http://meta.wikipedia.org/Enotif

Eauthent is a mechanism to use a temporary one-time password cycle
to check whether the email address a user has entered is a valid one.

The current patch has only been checked for (see DefaultSettings.php):

- php mail()
  ( = not using PEAR:Mail() module --- I do not know anyone who uses that)
  $wgSMTP = false;
- MySQL database
  ( = not using PostgreSQL --- I do not know anyone who uses that)
  $wgDBtype = "mysql";
  $wgSearchType = "MyISAM";

- STILL TODO:
  NEW (newpageletter) and CORR (minoreditletter) markers needs
  corresponding "spacers"

- table user_newtalk dropped; changes on usertalk pages and their
  notifications are now fully handled via existing table watchlist
  The user interface and behavious is unchanged to previous version.
- updaters.inc for compatibility with older mediawiki tables:
  the conversion script converts existing user_newtalk entries
  watchlist table entries
  (user_newtalk) id ==> (watchlist) NS_USER_TALK:namefromId(id) timestamp=1
- minor bug fixes:
  updated marker now correctly shown on watchlist page
  watching users number display with enhanced RC view + RCUseModStyle
- wfUrlencode() instead of rawurlencode() in enotif mails
- duplicate enotif code moved from UserTalkUpdate.php and
  merged into UserMailer.php and using usermailer() solely
- fixed an enotif mail text error for user names with spaces
- fixed missing part for suppressing watching user number

v1.36:
magic watchlist shows and counts now only the content page, notwithstanding
the content and talk page are stored separately in watchlist.
* bug fixed: rawurlencode for pagetitles in enotif mails
* bug fixed: link to userpages of anonymous user are correct now

* Enotif v1.34
 bugs fixed regarding missing $oldid parameter

* v1.33
* Details:
 Implements almost all enotif options as user preferences.
 These are only shown on the user preference page, if they are globally
 enabled by the corresponding admin option in DefaultSettings.php.
 Added admin feature to let enotifs appear to come from the page editor.
 This facilitates automatic mail sorting and anti-spam filtering; feature was
 originally proposed by Nick Triantos, thank you !
 Page editor's email address is however only shown, if this user enabled
 the option "reveal my email address" in user preferences. Otherwise,
 the enotifs appear to come from WikiAdmin as usual (tricky to program,
 but simply trust the algorithm. or look into UserMailer.php and
 UserTalkPage.php).

* Changes from previous enotif versions
* v1.31 is an improved version with many security and also cosmetic changes
 applied after two first reviews by Brion Vibber. v1.31 is basically the same as
 the older Enotif v1.30 and v1.22 versions.

 Added UseMod style for recent changes view so that only the most recent
 change of any page is listed. The (diff) and (hist) still allow to retrieve the
 older versions at users' discretion, but the RC view is much cleaner for
 trusted environments such as medium-size companies or family wikis.

* Enotif v1.30 redesign after review by Brion Vibber 25.10.2003

* v1.22 "updated (since my last visit)" also shown for users without stored
 email address in preferences, so that they can see, what watched pages
 have changed.
* show "updated (since my last visit)" markers in RC, history and watchlist
* Systemvariables to suppress updated marker in all views
* show number of watching users in RC and on bottom of articles in
 classic skin and in monobook skin
* Systemvariables in DefaultSettings.php to enable or disable features
* v1.21 now suppresses displaying the marker "updated (since my last visit)"
 in recent changes view for the older (already visited) versions of watched
 pages - i.e. page versions before the enotif was sent do not bear that
 marker any longer.
* enotif mails come with a link to the diff view between current and last
 visited version of the watching user.
*database structure is changed automatically when installing via the
 recommended way (starting index.php and re-using the old database name).
	run php /maintenance/update.php
 OR see /maintenance/archives/patch-email-notification.sql and apply the
 command
	ALTER TABLE  watchlist
	ADD (wl_notificationtimestamp varchar(14) binary NOT NULL default '0');
 manually to your database, which does not harm the non notification versions

*adding a page x to the watchlist does automatically add a watch
  for the accompanying talk_page talk:x and vice versa;

=== Caveats ===

Some output, particularly involving user-supplied inline HTML, may not
produce 100% valid or well-formed XHTML output. Testers are welcome to
set $wgMimeType = "application/xhtml+xml"; to test for remaining problem
cases, but this is not recommended on live sites. (This must be set for
MathML to display properly in Mozilla.)

The new 'MonoBook' skin is not compatible with PHP 5 due to bugs in the
underlying PHPTAL library. It will be automatically disabled when running
on PHP5; the older look and feel will be used instead.
