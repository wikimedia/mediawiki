= MediaWiki release notes =

Security reminder: MediaWiki does not require PHP's register_globals
setting since version 1.2.0. If you have it on, turn it *off* if you can.

== MediaWiki 1.14 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki is now using a "continuous integration" development model with
quarterly snapshot releases. The latest development code is always kept
"ready to run", and in fact runs our own sites on Wikipedia.

Release branches will continue to receive security updates for about a year
from first release, but nonessential bugfixes and feature developments
will be made on the development trunk and appear in the next quarterly release.

Those wishing to use the latest code instead of a branch release can obtain
it from source control: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Download_from_SVN

=== Configuration changes in 1.14 ===

* $wgExemptFromUserRobotsControl is an array of namespaces to be exempt from
  the effect of the new __INDEX__/__NOINDEX__ magic words.  (Default: null, ex-
  empt all content namespaces.)
* $wgForwardSearchUrl has been removed entirely. Documented setting since 1.4
  has been $wgSearchForwardUrl.

=== New features in 1.14 ===

* (bug 8068) New __INDEX__ and __NOINDEX__ magic words allow user control of
  search engine indexing on a per-article basis.
* Handheld stylesheet options
* Added 'DoEditSectionLink' hook as a cleaner unified version of the old
  'EditSectionLink' and 'EditSectionLinkForOther' hooks.  Note that the
  'EditSectionLinkForOther' hook has been removed, but 'EditSectionLink' is
  run in all cases instead, so extensions using the old hooks should still work
  if they ran roughly the same code for both hooks (as is almost certain).
* Signature (~~~~) "cleaning", i.e. template removal, can be disabled with 
  $wgCleanSignatures=false
* Extensions can use the SkinBuildSidebar hook to modify the content of the
  sidebar and add custom portlets to it
* Added 'MakeGlobalVariablesScript' hook for extensions to be able to add variables
  into into the output of Skin::makeVariablesScript
* Added $wgAddGroups and $wgRemoveGroups display on Special:ListGroupRights

=== Bug fixes in 1.14 ===

* (bug 14907) DatabasePostgres::fieldType now defined.
* (bug 14659) Passing the default limit param to Special:Recentchanges no more
  falls back to the user option
* (bug 14954) Fix regression in Modern and Simple skins
* Recursion loop check added to Categoryfinder class
* Fixed few performance troubles of large job queue processing
* Not setting various parameters in Foreign Repos now fails more gracefully
* (bug 2333) Redirects are properly rendered when previewing an edit.
* (bug 14972) Use localized alias of Special:Search on all search forms
* (bug 11035) Special:Search should have descriptive <title>

=== API changes in 1.14 ===

* Registration time of users registered before the DB field was created is now
  shown as empty instead of the current time.
* API search now falls back to fulltext search by default when using Lucene
  or other engine which doesn't support a separate title search function.
  This means you can use API search on Wikipedia without explicitly adding
  &srwhat=text to the query.
* Added iiprop=bitdepth to imageinfo and aiprop=bitdepth to allimages


=== Languages updated in 1.14 ===

MediaWiki supports over 300 languages. Many localisations are updated
regularly. Below only new and removed languages are listed.

(no changes yet)

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.14 requires PHP 5 (5.1 recommended). PHP 4 is no longer supported.

PHP 5.0.x fails on 64-bit systems due to serious bugs with array processing:
http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=34879
Upgrade affected systems to PHP 5.1 or higher.

MySQL 3.23.x is no longer supported; some older hosts may need to upgrade.
At this time we still recommend 4.0, but 4.1/5.0 will work fine in most cases.


== Upgrading ==

If upgrading from before 1.11, and you are using a wiki as a commons repository,
make sure that it is updated as well. Otherwise, errors may arise due to
database schema changes.

If upgrading from before 1.7, you may want to run refreshLinks.php to ensure
new database fields are filled with data.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, some major database
changes are made, and there is a slightly higher chance that things could
break. Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.


=== Caveats ===

Some output, particularly involving user-supplied inline HTML, may not
produce 100% valid or well-formed XHTML output. Testers are welcome to
set $wgMimeType = "application/xhtml+xml"; to test for remaining problem
cases, but this is not recommended on live sites. (This must be set for
MathML to display properly in Mozilla.)

For notes on 1.13.x and older releases, see HISTORY.


=== Online documentation ===

Documentation for both end-users and site administrators is currently being
built up on MediaWiki.org, and is covered under the GNU Free Documentation
License (except for pages that explicitly state that their contents are in
the public domain) :

  http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Documentation


=== Mailing list ===

A MediaWiki-l mailing list has been set up distinct from the Wikipedia
wikitech-l list:

  http://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-l

A low-traffic announcements-only list is also available:

  http://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-announce

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.


=== IRC help ===

There's usually someone online in #mediawiki on irc.freenode.net
