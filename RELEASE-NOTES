= MediaWiki release notes =

Security reminder: MediaWiki does not require PHP's register_globals
setting since version 1.2.0. If you have it on, turn it *off* if you can.



**** THIS FILE IS NOT UP TO DATE *****
**** BEFORE 1.4 RELEASE, BE SURE TO FIX IT *****

== Version 1.3.1, 2004-08-?? ==

Changes from 1.3.0:
* Watchlist parameters now work with register_globals off
* Fixed parsing of ''italics'' and '''bold''' mark-up (again)
* Special:Allpages display is more sensible on smaller wikis
* Fixed XHTML parsing error in classic skins
* Moved pages update watchlist correctly
* Fixed rebuildall.php on case-sensitive Unix filesystems
* New magic word PAGENAMEE (URL-escaped version of PAGENAME)
* Articles count now updated correctly when an article is moved
  in/out of the article namespace.  

== Version 1.3.0, 2004-08-11 ==

Look & layout:
* New default layout 'MonoBook' (available on PHP4 only currently)
* Print stylesheet now built-in to every page
* More or less correct XHTML 1.0 (served as text/html by default)

Wiki features:
* Image captions can now include links and other basic formatting
* Image bounding box can be specified instead of width, e.g. as
  100x100px, making the image not wider than 100px and not higher
  than 100px, keeping aspect ratio.
* Templates have been expanded with parameters, and separated from
  the MediaWiki: localization scheme.
* Categories more or less work
* added a special page for listing users with sysop rights.

Editing:
* Automatic merging of edit conflicts that don't directly interfere
* Edit summaries can now include basic formatting and links

Metadata and output:
* Linked Creative Commons copyright metadata (optional)
* RSS 2.0 & Atom 0.3 feeds for Recent Changes, New Pages

Optional modules:
* WikiHiero hieroglyphic module can be added (separate download)
* Timeline module can be added (separate download).
  Requires ploticus.
* TeX now has an experimental MathML output mode (incomplete!)

Installation and upgrading:
* The old install.php and update.php have been removed. In-place
  installation introduced in 1.2 is now the standard installation
  and upgrade method, see INSTALL and UPGRADE for directions.

Database:
* The links table has been changed to use a cur_id for l_from.
  The link tables must be converted on upgrade, which may entail
  some downtime.

Code and compatibility:
* Should now run clean with error reporting set to E_ALL.
* register_globals hack from 1.2 has been replaced with safer code
* Bundled PHPTAL 0.7.0 from http://phptal.sourceforge.net/
  (with some patches)
* Most image-related code moved to Image.php
* More fixes for PHP 4.1.2 (thanks to Asheesh Laroia)
* URL encoding fix for anchors
* All languages now available in UTF-8 mode
* Various other fixes

=== Caveats ===

Some output, particularly involving user-supplied inline HTML, may not
produce 100% valid or well-formed XHTML output. Testers are welcome to
set $wgMimeType = "application/xhtml+xml"; to test for remaining problem
cases, but this is not recommended on live sites. (This must be set for
MathML to display properly in Mozilla.)

The new 'MonoBook' skin is not compatible with PHP 5 due to bugs in the
underlying PHPTAL library. It will be automatically disabled when running
on PHP5; the older look and feel will be used instead.
