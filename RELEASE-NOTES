= MediaWiki release notes =

Security reminder: MediaWiki does not require PHP's register_globals
setting since version 1.2.0. If you have it on, turn it *off* if you can.

== MediaWiki 1.11 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET.

MediaWiki is now using a "continuous integration" development model with
quarterly snapshot releases. The latest development code is always kept
"ready to run", and in fact runs our own sites on Wikipedia.

Release branches will continue to receive security updates for about a year
from first release, but nonessential bugfixes and feature developments
will be made on the development trunk and appear in the next quarterly release.

Those wishing to use the latest code instead of a branch release can obtain
it from source control: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Download_from_SVN

== Configuration changes since 1.10 ==


== New features since 1.10 ==

* (bug 8868) Separate "blocked" message for autoblocks
* Adding expiry of block to block messages
* Bulk mail options ($wgEnotifImpersonal, $wgEnotifUseJobQ) for large sites

== Bugfixes since 1.10 ==

* (bug 9712) Use Arabic comma in date/time formats for Arabic and Farsi

* (bug 3431) Suppress "next page" link in Special:Search at end of results
* Don't show unblock form if the user doesn't have permission to use it
  (cosmetic change, no vulnerabilities existed)
* Subtitle success message when unblocking a block ID instead of a pseudo link
  like [[User:#123|#123]]
* Use the standard HTTP fetch functions when retrieving remote wiki pages
  through transwiki, so we can take advantage of cURL goodies if available
* Disable custom user javascript in Special:Preferences, to avoid the risk
  of a compromised script sniffing passwords etc.
* (bug 9854, 3770) Clip overflow text in gallery boxes for visual cleanliness
  instead of letting it flow outside the box or trigger ugly scroll bars.
* Tooltips for print version and permalink

  values are no longer shown as redlinks

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.11 requires PHP 5 (5.1 recommended). PHP 4 is no longer supported.

PHP 5.0.x fails on 64-bit systems due to serious bugs with array processing:
http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=34879
Upgrade affected systems to PHP 5.1 or higher.

MySQL 3.23.x is no longer supported; some older hosts may need to upgrade.
At this time we still recommend 4.0, but 4.1/5.0 will work fine in most cases.


== Upgrading ==

1.11 has several database changes since 1.10, and will not work without schema
updates.

If upgrading from before 1.7, you may want to run refreshLinks.php to ensure
new database fields are filled with data.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, some major database
changes are made, and there is a slightly higher chance that things could
break. Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.

=== Caveats ===

Some output, particularly involving user-supplied inline HTML, may not
produce 100% valid or well-formed XHTML output. Testers are welcome to
set $wgMimeType = "application/xhtml+xml"; to test for remaining problem
cases, but this is not recommended on live sites. (This must be set for
MathML to display properly in Mozilla.)


For notes on 1.10.x and older releases, see HISTORY.


=== Online documentation ===

Documentation for both end-users and site administrators is currently being
built up on MediaWiki.org, and is covered under the GNU Free Documentation
License (except for pages that explicitly state that their contents are in
the public domain) :

=== Mailing list ===

A MediaWiki-l mailing list has been set up distinct from the Wikipedia
wikitech-l list:

  http://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-l

A low-traffic announcements-only list is also available:

  http://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-announce

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.


=== IRC help ===

There's usually someone online in #mediawiki on irc.freenode.net
