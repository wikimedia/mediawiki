Security reminder: MediaWiki does not require PHP's register_globals
setting since version 1.2.0. If you have it on, turn it *off* if you can.

== MediaWiki 1.13 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki is now using a "continuous integration" development model with
quarterly snapshot releases. The latest development code is always kept
"ready to run", and in fact runs our own sites on Wikipedia.

Release branches will continue to receive security updates for about a year
from first release, but nonessential bugfixes and feature developments
will be made on the development trunk and appear in the next quarterly release.

Those wishing to use the latest code instead of a branch release can obtain
it from source control: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Download_from_SVN

=== Configuration changes in 1.13 ===

* New option $wgFeed can be set false to turn off syndication feeds
* (bug 13137) Allow setting 'editprotected' right separately from 'protect',
  so groups may optionally edit protected pages without being able to protect
  pages themselves

=== New features in 1.13 ===

* __HIDDENCAT__ on a category page causes the category to be hidden on the
  article page.
* Don't show edit permissions errors on a red link click, just redirect to the
  article. This is so that readers who don't know what a red link is aren't
  confused when they are told they are range-blocked.
* Add a new hook ImageBeforeProduceHTML to allow extensions to modify wikitext
  image syntax output.
* (bug 13100) Added 'preloadtitle' parameter to action=edit&section=new that
  pre-fills the section title field.

=== Bug fixes in 1.13 ===

* (bug 10677) Add link to the file description page on the shared repository
* (bug 13084) Increase size of source/destination filename fields in upload form
* (bug 13115) rebuildrecentchanges should print the current value of $wgRCMaxAge
* (bug 13140) Show parent categories in category namespace
* (bug 13149) Correctly format 'fileexists' message on Upload page
* Make the default filepageexists message accurate
* (bug 12988) $wgMinimalPasswordLength no longer breaks create user by email
* (bug 13022) Fix upload from URL on PHP 5.0.x
* (bug 13132) Unable to unprotect pages protected with earlier versions of MediaWiki
* (bug 12723) OpenSearch description name now uses more compact language code
  to avoid passing the length limit as often, is customizable per site via
  'opensearch-desc' message.
* (bug 13135) Special:Userrights now passes IDs through form submission
  to allow functionality on not-quite-right usernames


=== API changes in 1.13 ===

* Fixing main page display in meta=siteinfo
* (bug 13128) Added patrolled flag to list=recentchanges
* Implemented {bl,ei,iu}redirect (lists links through redirects as well)
* (bug 13154) Introduced subpages flag to meta=siteinfo&siprop=namespaces
* (bug 13157) Added ucuserprefix parameter to list=usercontibs
* (bug 12394) Added rctitles parameter to list=recentchanges, making rcid retrieval easier

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.13 requires PHP 5 (5.1 recommended). PHP 4 is no longer supported.

PHP 5.0.x fails on 64-bit systems due to serious bugs with array processing:
http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=34879
Upgrade affected systems to PHP 5.1 or higher.

MySQL 3.23.x is no longer supported; some older hosts may need to upgrade.
At this time we still recommend 4.0, but 4.1/5.0 will work fine in most cases.


== Upgrading ==

1.13 has several database changes since 1.12, and will not work without schema
updates.

If upgrading from before 1.7, you may want to run refreshLinks.php to ensure
new database fields are filled with data.

If upgrading from before 1.11, and you are using a wiki as a commons repository,
make sure that it is updated as well. Otherwise, errors may arise due to
database schema changes.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, some major database
changes are made, and there is a slightly higher chance that things could
break. Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.


=== Caveats ===

Some output, particularly involving user-supplied inline HTML, may not
produce 100% valid or well-formed XHTML output. Testers are welcome to
set $wgMimeType = "application/xhtml+xml"; to test for remaining problem
cases, but this is not recommended on live sites. (This must be set for
MathML to display properly in Mozilla.)

For notes on 1.12.x and older releases, see HISTORY.


=== Online documentation ===

Documentation for both end-users and site administrators is currently being
built up on MediaWiki.org, and is covered under the GNU Free Documentation
License (except for pages that explicitly state that their contents are in
the public domain) :

  http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Documentation


=== Mailing list ===

A MediaWiki-l mailing list has been set up distinct from the Wikipedia
wikitech-l list:

  http://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-l

A low-traffic announcements-only list is also available:

  http://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-announce

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.


=== IRC help ===

There's usually someone online in #mediawiki on irc.freenode.net
