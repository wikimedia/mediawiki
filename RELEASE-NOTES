== MediaWiki 1.16 beta 3 ==

2010-05-28

This is a pre-release beta of the MediaWiki 1.16 branch.

=== Summary of selected changes in 1.16 ===

Selected changes since MediaWiki 1.15 that may be of interest:

* Watchlists now have RSS/Atom feeds. RSS feeds generally are now hidden, 
  since Atom is a better protocol and is supported by virtually all clients.

* It's now possible to block users from sending email via Special:Emailuser.

* The maintenance script system was overhauled. Most maintenance scripts now 
  have a useful help page when you run them with --help.

* AdminSettings.php is no longer required in order to run maintenance scripts. 
  You can just set $wgDBadminuser and $wgDBadminpassword in your 
  LocalSettings.php instead.

* The preferences system was overhauled. Preferences are stored in a more 
  compact format. Changes to site default preferences will automatically 
  affect all users who have not chosen a different preference.

* Support for SQLite was improved. Some broken features were fixed, and it 
  now has an efficient full-text search.

* The user groups ACL system was improved by allowing rights to be revoked, 
  instead of just granted.

* A new localisation caching system was introduced, which will make MediaWiki 
  faster for almost everyone, especially when lots of extensions are enabled.

By default, this new system makes a lot of database queries. If your database 
is particularly slow, or if your system administrator limits your query count, 
or if you want to squeeze as much performance as possible out of Mediawiki, 
set $wgCacheDirectory to a writable path on the local filesystem. Make sure 
you have the DBA extension for PHP installed, this will improve performance 
further.

* (bug 23769) Disabled HTML 5 client-side form validation. Was introduced in

* Fixed a bug in uploads for non-JavaScript clients. An empty string was used
  as the default destination filename, instead of the source filename as

  account" and "create by e-mail" features of [[Special:Userlogin]]

=== Configuration changes in 1.16 ===

* (bug 18222) $wgMinimalPasswordLength default is now 1
* $wgSessionHandler can be used to configure session.save_handler
* $wgLocalFileRepo/$wgForeignFileRepos now have a 'fileMode' parameter to
  be used when uploading/moving files
* (bug 18761) $wgHiddenPrefs is a new array for specifying preferences not
  to be shown to users
* $wgAllowRealName and $wgAllowUserSkin were deprecated in favor of
  $wgHiddenPrefs[] = 'realname', but the former are still retained
  for backwards-compatibility
* (bug 9257) $wgRCMaxAge now defaults to three months
* $wgDevelopmentWarnings can be set to true to show warnings about deprecated
  functions and other potential errors when developing.
* Subpages are now enabled in the MediaWiki namespace by default.  This is
  mainly a cosmetic change, and does not in any way affect the MessageCache,
  which was already effectively treating the namespace as if it had subpages.
* Oracle: maintenance/ora/user.sql script for creating DB user on oracle with
  appropriate privileges. Creating this user with web-install page requires
  oci8.privileged_connect set to On in php.ini.
* Removed UserrightsChangeableGroups hook introduced in 1.14
* Added $wgCacheDirectory, to replace $wgFileCacheDirectory,
  $wgLocalMessageCache, and any other local caches which need a place to put
  files.
* $wgFileCacheDirectory is no longer set to anything by default, and so either
  needs to be set explicitly, or $wgCacheDirectory needs to be set instead.
* $wgLocalMessageCache has been removed. Instead, set $wgUseLocalMessageCache
  to true
* Removed $wgEnableSerializedMessages and $wgCheckSerialized. Similar
  functionality is now available via $wgLocalisationCacheConf.

  interface will not appear in Special:AllMessages.
* $wgRegisterInternalExternals can be used to record external links pointing
  to same server
* (bug 19907) $wgCrossSiteAJAXdomains and $wgCrossSiteAJAXdomainExceptions added
  to control which external domains may access the API via cross-site AJAX.
* $wgMaintenanceScripts for extensions to add their scripts to the default list
* $wgMemoryLimit has been added, default value '50M'
* $wgExtraRandompageSQL is deprecated, the SpecialRandomGetRandomTitle hook
  should be used instead
* (bug 20489) $wgIllegalFileChars added to override the default list of illegal
  characters in file names.
* (bug 19646) $wgImgAuthDetails added  to display reason access to uploaded file
  was denied to users(img_auth only)
* (bug 19646) $wgImgAuthPublicTest added to test to see if img_auth set up
  correctly (img_auth only)
* $wgUploadMaintenance added to disable file deletions and restorations during

* (bug 3340) $wgBlockCIDRLimit added (default: 16) to configure the low end of
  CIDR ranges for blocking

  file repository

* $wgPreviewOnOpenNamespaces for extensions that create namespaces that behave
  similarly to the category namespace.
* $wgEnableSorbs renamed to $wgDnsBlacklistUrls ($wgEnableSorbs kept for
  backward compatibility)
* $wgUploadNavigationUrl now also affects images inline images that do not
  exist. In that case the URL will get (?|&)wpDestFile=<filename> appended to
  it as appropriate.
* If $wgLocaltimezone is null, use the server's timezone as the default for
  signatures. This was always the behaviour documented in DefaultSettings.php
  but has not been the actual behaviour for some time: instead, UTC was used
  by default.
* Added $wgExtensionAssetsPath, to decouple assets serving from $wgScriptPath.
  If not specified it will default to $wgScriptPath/extensions
* Added $wgCountTotalSearchHits to make search UI display total number of hits
  with some search engines.
* Added $wgAdvertisedFeedTypes to decide what feed types (RSS, Atom, both, or
  neither) MediaWiki advertises.  Default is array( 'atom' ), so RSS is no
  longer advertised by default (but it still works).
* Added $wgMemCachedTimeout, controls how long to wait for data from the
  memcached servers.
* New configuration variables $wgDebugTimestamps and $wgDebugPrintHttpHeaders
  for controlling debug output.
* New $wgBlockDisablesLogin when set to true disallows blocked users from
  logging in.

  have these rights stripped from them.
* Added a PHP port of CDB (constant database), for improved local caching when
  the DBA extension is not available.
* Introduced a new system for localisation caching. The system is based around
  fast fetches of individual messages, minimising memory overhead and startup
  time in the typical case. The database backend will be used by default, but
  set $wgCacheDirectory to get a faster CDB-based implementation.
* Expanded the number of variables which can be set in the extension messages
  files.
* Added a feature to allow per-article process pool size control for the parsing
  task, to limit resource usage when the cache for a heavily-viewed article is
  invalidated. Requires an external daemon.
* (bug 19576) Moved the id attribues from the anchors accompanying section

  use

  This can be disabled by setting $wgHtml5 = false;.  Specific features enabled
  if HTML 5 is used:

** The summary attribute has been removed from tables of contents.  summary is
   obsolete in HTML 5 and wasn't useful here anyway.

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.16 requires PHP 5.1 (5.2 recommended). PHP 4 is no longer supported.

MySQL 3.23.x is no longer supported; some older hosts may need to upgrade.
At this time we still recommend 4.0, but 4.1/5.0 will work fine in most cases.


== Upgrading ==

1.16 has several database changes since 1.15, and will not work without schema
updates.

If upgrading from before 1.11, and you are using a wiki as a commons reposito-
ry, make sure that it is updated as well. Otherwise, errors may arise due to
database schema changes.

If upgrading from before 1.7, you may want to run refreshLinks.php to ensure
new database fields are filled with data.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, some major database
changes are made, and there is a slightly higher chance that things could
break. Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.


=== Caveats ===

Some output, particularly involving user-supplied inline HTML, may not
produce 100% valid or well-formed XHTML output. Testers are welcome to
set $wgMimeType = "application/xhtml+xml"; to test for remaining problem
cases, but this is not recommended on live sites. (This must be set for
MathML to display properly in Mozilla.)

For notes on 1.15.x and older releases, see HISTORY.


=== Online documentation ===

Documentation for both end-users and site administrators is currently being
built up on MediaWiki.org, and is covered under the GNU Free Documentation
License (except for pages that explicitly state that their contents are in
the public domain) :

=== Mailing list ===

A MediaWiki-l mailing list has been set up distinct from the Wikipedia
wikitech-l list:

  http://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-l

A low-traffic announcements-only list is also available:

  http://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-announce

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.


=== IRC help ===

There's usually someone online in #mediawiki on irc.freenode.net
