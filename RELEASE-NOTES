= MediaWiki release notes =

Security reminder: MediaWiki does not require PHP's register_globals
setting since version 1.2.0. If you have it on, turn it *off* if you can.

== MediaWiki 1.10 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET.

MediaWiki is now using a "continuous integration" development model with
quarterly snapshot releases. The latest development code is always kept
"ready to run", and in fact runs our own sites on Wikipedia.

Release branches will continue to receive security updates for about a year
from first release, but nonessential bugfixes and feature developments 
will be made on the development trunk and appear in the next quarterly release.

Those wishing to use the latest code instead of a branch release can obtain
it from source control: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Download_from_SVN

== Configuration changes ==

=== $wgCommandLineDarkBg ==

A new switch used by maintenance scripts (parserTests.php). It lets you specify
if your terminal use a dark background, the colorized output will be made
lighter making things easier to read.

== Major new features ==

== Changes since 1.9 ==

* (bug 7292) Fix site statistics when moving pages in/out of content namespaces
* (bug 6937) Introduce "statistics-footer" message, appended to Special:Statistics
* (bug 8531) Correct local name of Lingála
* (bug 6638) List block flags in block log entries
* New script maintenance/language/checkExtensioni18n.php used to check i18n
  progress in the extension repository.
* Running maintenance/parserTests.php with '--record' option, will now
  automatically attempt to create the required tables
* Made the PLURAL: parser function return singular on -1 per default
* Fixed up the AjaxSearch
* (bugs 5051, 5376) Tooltips and accesskeys no longer require JavaScript

  starts page output (http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-l/2007-January/028554.html)
* Fix SpecialVersion->formatCredits input. Version and Url parameters should be
  null to be treated properly with isset.

* Introduce "cascading protection" -- implicit protection on pages transcluded
  into a page protected with this option enabled

  customized via the $wgNamespaceProtection array. By default, editing pages in
  the MediaWiki namespace requires "editinterface" permission, as before.
* (bug 8567) Added hook RawPageViewBeforeOutput just before the text is blown
  out in action=raw, so extensions might influence the output.
* Correct tooltip accesskey hint for Opera on the Macintosh
  (uses Shift-Esc-, not Ctrl-).

  overridden by adding diffonly=1 or diffonly=0 to the URL of the diff page

* (bug 6171) Magically close tags in tables when not using Tidy.

* New special page, Special:Protectedpages, which shows all protected pages
  and their protection status (full protection status is not pulled out due
  to performance considerations, so it just shows "full protected" or
  "semi protected".
* (bug 4133) Allow page protections to be made with an expiry date, in the same format
  as block expiry dates. Existing protections are assumed to be infinite, as are protections
  made with the new field left blank.

* (bug 4268) Fixed data-loss bug in compressOld batch text compression

  for better localisations.
* (bug 8944) The deprecated is_a() function is used in StubObjects.php
* (bug 8978) Georgian i18n update
* (bug 8992) Fix a remaining raw use of REQUEST_URI in history
* (bug 3678) Allow disabling MediaWiki:aboutsite in the same way as
  MediaWiki:Disclaimers; Also means that if any of the footer links are
  disabled in the wiki's default language (by setting to "-"), they'll also
  be disabled in other languages too (e.g. if the user specifies uselang=fr).
* (bug 8999) User.php gives "undefined user editcount" PHP notice.
* (bug 8984) Fix a database error in Special:Recentchangeslinked
  when using the Postgres database.
* Sort log types in Special:Log
* Added a classname ("mw-toolbar-editbutton") and unique IDs to the edit
  toolbar buttons

  The ob_start() section should preferably be removed from older 
  LocalSettings.php files.
* Give Content-Length header for HTTP/1.0 clients.
* Partial support for Flash cross-domain-policy filtering. 
* Hide irrelevant block options in Special:Blockip based on whether an
  IP address/range or username is listed. (Dynamic using JS.)
* Lazy-initialize site_stats row on load when empty. Somewhat kinder to
  dump-based installations, avoiding PHP warnings when NUMBEROFARTICLES
  and such are used.
* Add 'charset' to Content-Type headers on various HTTP error responses
  to forestall additional UTF-7-autodetect XSS issues. PHP sends only
  'text/html' by default when the script didn't specify more details,
  which some inconsiderate browsers consider a license to autodetect
  the deadly, hard-to-escape UTF-7.
    This fixes an issue with the Ajax interface error message on MSIE when
  $wgUseAjax is enabled (not default configuration); this UTF-7 variant
  on a previously fixed attack vector was discovered by Moshe BA from BugSec:
  http://www.bugsec.com/articles.php?Security=24
* Trackback responses now specify XML content type

* Link from Special:log/protect to change protection form
* Fix fallback implementation of mb_strlen so it works and isn't insanely
  slow for large strings, since it's used for page edit lengths
* (bug 8815) Setting password in initUser() breaks LdapAuthentication plugin
* (bug 9256) Add a quick note to index.php header comments

* Ignore lonely '''''

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.10 requires PHP 5 (5.1 recommended). PHP 4 is no longer supported.

PHP 5.0.x fails on 64-bit systems due to serious bugs with array processing:
http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=34879
Upgrade affected systems to PHP 5.1 or higher.

MySQL 3.23.x is no longer supported; some older hosts may need to upgrade.
At this time we still recommend 4.0, but 4.1/5.0 will work fine in most cases.


== Upgrading ==

1.10 has several database changes since 1.9, and will not work without schema
updates.

If upgrading from before 1.7, you may want to run refreshLinks.php to ensure
new database fields are filled with data.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, some major database
changes are made, and there is a slightly higher chance that things could
break. Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.

=== Caveats ===

Some output, particularly involving user-supplied inline HTML, may not
produce 100% valid or well-formed XHTML output. Testers are welcome to
set $wgMimeType = "application/xhtml+xml"; to test for remaining problem
cases, but this is not recommended on live sites. (This must be set for
MathML to display properly in Mozilla.)

=== Online documentation ===

Documentation for both end-users and site administrators is currently being
built up on Meta-Wikipedia, and is covered under the GNU Free Documentation

=== Mailing list ===

A MediaWiki-l mailing list has been set up distinct from the Wikipedia
wikitech-l list:

  http://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-l

A low-traffic announcements-only list is also available:

  http://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-announce

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.
