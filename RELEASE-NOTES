= MediaWiki release notes =

Security reminder: MediaWiki does not require PHP's register_globals
setting since version 1.2.0. If you have it on, turn it *off* if you can.

== MediaWiki 1.12.0 ==

This is the quarterly branch release of MediaWiki for Winter 2008.


MediaWiki is now using a "continuous integration" development model with
quarterly snapshot releases. The latest development code is always kept
"ready to run", and in fact runs our own sites on Wikipedia.

Release branches will continue to receive security updates for about a year
from first release, but nonessential bugfixes and feature developments
will be made on the development trunk and appear in the next quarterly release.

Those wishing to use the latest code instead of a branch release can obtain
it from source control: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Download_from_SVN


Changes since 1.12.0rc1:

* (bug 13359) Double-escaping in Special:Allpages
* Localization updates.

=== Configuration changes in 1.12 ===
* Marking edits as bot edits with Special:Contributions?bot=1 now requires the
  markbotedit permission, rather than the rollback permission previously used.
  This permission is assigned by default to the sysop group.
* MediaWiki now checks if serialized files are out of date. New configuration
  variable $wgCheckSerialized can be set to false to enable old behavior (i.e.
  to not check and assume they are always up to date)
* The rollback permission can now be rate-limited using the normal mechanism.
* New configuration variable $wgExtraLanguageNames
* Behaviour of $wgAddGroups and $wgRemoveGroups changed. New behaviour:
* * Granting the userrights privilege allows arbitrary changing of rights.
* * Without the userrights privilege, a user will be able to add and/or
     remove the groups specified in $wgAddGroups and $wgRemoveGroups for
     any groups they are in.
* New permission userrights-interwiki for changing user rights on foreign wikis.
* $wgImplictGroups for groups that are hidden from Special:Listusers, etc.
* $wgAutopromote: automatically promote users who match specified criteria
* $wgGroupsAddToSelf, $wgGroupsRemoveFromSelf: allow users to add or remove
  themselves from specified groups via Special:Userrights.
* When $wgUseTidy has been enabled, PHP's Tidy module is now used if it is
  present, in preference to an external Tidy executable which may or may not
  be present. To force use of external Tidy even when the PHP module is
  available, set $wgTidyInternal to false.


=== New features in 1.12 ===
* (bug 10735) Add a warning for non-descriptive filenames at Special:Upload
* Add {{filepath:}} parser function to get full path to an uploaded file,
  complementing {{fullurl:}} for pages.
* (bug 11136) If using Postgres, search path is explicitly set if wgDBmwschema
  is not set to 'mediawiki', allowing multiple mediawiki instances per user.

* (bug 5412) Add feed links for the site to all pages
* (bug 11353) Add ability to retrieve raw section content via action=raw

  source" tab entirely if the page doesn't exist and the user isn't allowed to
  create it

* AuthPlugin added strictUserAuth() method to allow per-user override
  of the strict() authentication behavior.

* isValidEmailAddr hook added to User method of that name, to allow, e.g., re-
  stricting e-mail addresses to a specific domain
* Removed "Clear" link in watchlist editor tools, as people were afraid to
  click it. Existing clear links will fall back to the raw editor, which is
  very easy to clear your watchlist with.

  on Special:Newpages
* LogLine hook added to allow formatting custom entries in Special:Log.
* Support for Iranian calendar

  user page
* Added --override switch for disabled pages in updateSpecialPages.php
* Provide a unique message (ipb_blocked_as_range) if unblock of a single IP
  fails
  because it is part of a blocked range.
* (bug 3973) Use a separate message for the email content when an account is
  created by another user
* dumpTextPass.php can spawn fetchText.php as a subprocess, which should restart
  cleanly if database connections fail unpleasantly.
* (bug 12028) Add Special:Listbots as shortcut for Special:Listusers/bot
* (bug 9633) Add a predefined list of delete reasons to the deletion form
* Show a warning message when creating/editing a user (talk) page but the user
  does not exists

* It is now possible to change rights on other local wikis without the MakeSysop
  extension
* Add HTML ID's mw-read-only-warning and mw-anon-edit-warning to warnings when
  editing to allow CSS styling.
* Parser now returns list of sections
* When a user is prohibited from creating a page, a title of "View source"
  makes no sense, and there should be no "Return to [[Page]]" link.
* (bug 12486) Protected titles now give a warning for privileged editors.
* (bug 9939) Special:Search now sets focus to search input box when no existing
  search is active
* For Special:Userrights, use GET instead of POST to search for users.
* Allow subpage syntax for Special:Userrights, i.e., Special:Userrights/Name.
* When submitting changes on Special:Userrights, show the full form again, not
  just the search box.
* Added exception hooks
* (bug 12574) Allow bots to specify whether an edit should be marked as a bot
  edit, via the parameter 'bot'. (Default: '1')

* (bug 12655) Added $wgUserEmailUseReplyTo config option to put sender
  address in Reply-To instead of From for user-to-user emails.
  This protects against SPF problems and privacy-leaking bounce messages
  when using mailers that set the envelope sender to the From header value.
* (bug 11897) Add alias [[Special:CreateAccount]] & [[Special:Userlogin/signup]]
  for Special:Userlogin?type=signup
* (bug 12214) Add a predefined list of delete reasons to the file deletion form
* Merged backends for OpenSearch suggestions and AJAX search.
  Both now accept namespace prefixes, handle 'Media:' and 'Special:' pages,
  and reject interwiki prefixes. PrefixSearch class centralizes this code,
  and the backend part can be overridden by the PrefixSearchBackend hook.
* (bug 10365) Localization of Special:Version

  and installed when at the superuser level.
* The default robot policy for the entire wiki is now configurable via the
  $wgDefaultRobotPolicy setting.

== Parser changes in 1.12 ==

For help with migration to the MediaWiki 1.12 parser, please visit:

http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Migration_to_the_new_preprocessor

The parser pass order has changed from

   * Extension tag strip and render
   * HTML normalisation and security
   * Template expansion
   * Main section...

to

   * Template and extension tag parse to intermediate representation
   * Template expansion and extension rendering
   * HTML normalisation and security
   * Main section...

The main effect of this for the user is that the rules for uncovered syntax
have changed.

Uncovered main-pass syntax, such as HTML tags, are now generally valid, whereas
previously in some cases they were escaped. For example, you could have "<ta" in
one template, and "ble>" in another template, and put them together to make a
valid <table> tag. Previously the result would have been "&lt;table&gt;".

Uncovered preprocessor syntax is generally not recognised. For example, if you
have "{{a" in Template:A and "b}}" in Template:B, then "{{a}}{{b}}" will be
converted to a literal "{{ab}}" rather than the contents of Template:Ab. This
was the case previously in HTML output mode, and is now uniformly the case in
the other modes as well. HTML-style comments uncovered by template expansion
will not be recognised by the preprocessor and hence will not prevent template
expansion within them, but they will be stripped by the following HTML security
pass.

Bug 5678 has been fixed. This has a number of user-visible effects related to
the removal of this double-parse. Please see the wiki page for examples. 

Message transformation mode has been removed, and replaced with "preprocess"
mode. This means that some MediaWiki namespace messages may need to be updated,
especially ones which took advantage of the terribly counterintuitive behaviour
of the former message mode. 

The header identification routines for section edit and for numbering section
edit links have been merged. This removes a significant failure mode and fixes a
whole category of bugs (tracked by bug #4899). Wikitext headings uncovered by
template expansion will still be rendered into a heading tag, and will get an 
entry in the TOC, but will not have a section edit link. HTML-style headings 
will also not have a section edit link. Valid wikitext headings present in the 
template source text will get a template section edit link. This is a major 
break from previous behaviour, but I believe the effects are almost entirely 
beneficial.

The main motivation for making these changes was performance. The new two-pass
preprocessor can skip "dead branches" in template expansion, such as unfollowed
#switch cases and unused defaults for template arguments. This provides a
significant performance improvement in template-heavy test cases taken from
Wikipedia. Parser function hooks can participate in this performance improvement
by using the new SFH_OBJECT_ARGS flag during registration.

The pre-expand include size limit has been removed, since there's no efficient
way to calculate such a figure, and it would now be meaningless for performance
anyway. The "preprocessor node count" takes its place, with a generous default
limit.

The context in which XML-style extension tags are called has changed, so
extensions which make use of the parser state may need compatibility changes.

The new preprocessor syntax has been documented in Backus-Naur Form at:

http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Preprocessor_ABNF

The ExpandTemplates extension now has the ability to generate an XML parse 
tree from wikitext source. This parse tree corresponds closely to the grammar
documented on that page.

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.12 requires PHP 5 (5.1 recommended). PHP 4 is no longer supported.

PHP 5.0.x fails on 64-bit systems due to serious bugs with array processing:
http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=34879
Upgrade affected systems to PHP 5.1 or higher.

MySQL 3.23.x is no longer supported; some older hosts may need to upgrade.
At this time we still recommend 4.0, but 4.1/5.0 will work fine in most cases.


== Upgrading ==

1.12 has several database changes since 1.11, and will not work without schema
updates.

If upgrading from before 1.7, you may want to run refreshLinks.php to ensure
new database fields are filled with data.

If upgrading from before 1.11, and you are using a wiki as a commons repository,
make sure that it is updated as well. Otherwise, errors may arise due to
database schema changes.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, some major database
changes are made, and there is a slightly higher chance that things could
break. Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.


=== Caveats ===

Some output, particularly involving user-supplied inline HTML, may not
produce 100% valid or well-formed XHTML output. Testers are welcome to
set $wgMimeType = "application/xhtml+xml"; to test for remaining problem
cases, but this is not recommended on live sites. (This must be set for
MathML to display properly in Mozilla.)

For notes on 1.11.x and older releases, see HISTORY.


=== Online documentation ===

Documentation for both end-users and site administrators is currently being
built up on MediaWiki.org, and is covered under the GNU Free Documentation
License (except for pages that explicitly state that their contents are in
the public domain) :

  http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Documentation


=== Mailing list ===

A MediaWiki-l mailing list has been set up distinct from the Wikipedia
wikitech-l list:

  http://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-l

A low-traffic announcements-only list is also available:

  http://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-announce

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.


=== IRC help ===

There's usually someone online in #mediawiki on irc.freenode.net
