= MediaWiki release notes =

Security reminder: MediaWiki does not require PHP's register_globals
setting since version 1.2.0. If you have it on, turn it *off* if you can.

== MediaWiki 1.7.1 ==

July 8, 2006

MediaWiki 1.7.1 is a security and bugfix maintenance release of the
Summer 2006 snapshot:

A potential HTML/JavaScript-injection vulnerability in a debugging script
has been fixed. Only versions and configurations of PHP vulnerable to the
$GLOBALS overwrite vulnerability are affected.

As a workaround for existing installs, profileinfo.php may simply be deleted
if it's not being used.

* Fix for 'emailconfirmed' implicit user group
* Fix for upgrades on some versions of MySQL 4.0.x
* Fixed potential XSS in profileinfo.php
* Installer now shows clear error message about old PHP versions
  rather than a confusing parse error


== MediaWiki 1.7.0 ==

July 6, 2006

This is the quarterly release snapshot for Summer 2006. While the code
has been running on Wikipedia for some time, installation and upgrade
bits may be less well tested. Bug fix releases may follow in the coming
days or weeks.


MediaWiki is now using a "continuous integration" development model with
quarterly snapshot releases. The latest development code is always kept
"ready to run", and in fact runs our own sites on Wikipedia.

Release branches will continue to receive security updates for about a year
from first release, but nonessential bugfixes and feature development happen
will be made on the development trunk and appear in the next quarterly release.

Those wishing to use the latest code instead of a branch release can obtain
it from source control: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Download_from_SVN


== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.7 requires PHP 5 (5.1 recommended). PHP 4 is no longer supported.

If you are unable to run PHP 5, you may have to stick with 1.6 for now.

MySQL 3.23.x is no longer supported; some older hosts may need to upgrade.
At this time we still recommend 4.0, but 4.1/5.0 will work fine in most cases.

Experimental Oracle support has been dropped as it is unmaintained.


== Upgrading ==

Several changes to the database have been made from 1.6:

* A new "langlinks" table tracks interlanguage links
* A new "filearchive" table stores information on deleted files
* A new "querycache_info" table stores information on query page updates

To ensure that these tables are filled with data, run refreshLinks.php after
the upgrade.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, some major database
changes are made, and there is a slightly higher chance that things could
break. Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.


== Configuration changes ==

Some configuration options have changed:
* $wgAllowExternalImages now defaults to off for increased security.
* $wgLocalTZoffset was in hours, it is now using minutes.
* Extensions may register special pages via the $wgSpecialPages array
  without forcing an early load of the SpecialPage.php class file.


== Major new features ==

* Deleted files can now be archived and undeleted, if you set up
  an appropriate non-web-accessible directory.
  Set $wgSaveDeletedFiles on and an appropriate directory path in
  $wgFileStore['deleted']['directory']
* Experimental PostgreSQL support has been updated. It may or may
  not be in usable shape; those interested in PostgreSQL are encouraged
  to follow 1.8 development.

* Sanitizer::validateTagAttributes now available to discard illegal/unsafe
  attribute values from an array.
* (bug 3837) Leave <center> as is instead of doing an unsafe text replacement
  to <div class="center">. <center> is perfectly valid in the target doctype
  (XHTML 1.0 Transitional), while the replacement didn't catch all cases and
  could even result in invalid output from valid input. 
* (bug 4280) Use 'noindex,nofollow' instead of 'noindex,follow' for default
  meta robots tag on diff view and special pages. Should reduce impact of
  robots on scrolling special pages, diffs etc on sites where robots.txt
  doesn't forbid access.

  edit with 'preview on first edit' enabled.

* (bug 6255) Fix transclusions starting with "#" or "*" in HTML attributes
* Whitespace now normalized more or less properly in HTML attributes

* Update to Vlax Romany localization (rmy)
* Update to Latin translation (la)
* Update to Dutch translation (nl)
* Avoid some notices in page history with bad input
* Use double quoted consistently on attributes in linker output; preparing
  for new normalization code when tidy not in use
* Replace "nogomatch" with "noexactmatch" and place the magic colon in the messages
  themselves. Some minor tweaks to the actual message content.
* Introduce $wgContentNamespaces which allows for articles to exist in namespaces other
  than the main namespace, and still be counted as valid content in the site statistics.
* (bug 5932) Introduce {{PAGESINNAMESPACE}} magic word
* Disable $wgAllowExternalImages by default.
* (bug 2700) Nice things like link completion and signatures now work in <gallery> tags.
* Cancel output buffering in StreamFile; when used inside gzip buffering this
  could cause funny timeout behavior as the Content-Length was wrong.
* Return correct content-type header with 304 responses for StreamFile;
  it confuses Safari if you let it return "text/html".

* Introduce optional (off by default) language selector bar for user login
  and registration. Customisable via the "loginlanguagelinks" message, the
  links will preserve "returnto" values. If the user creates an account while
  using such a link, then the language in use will be saved as their language
  preference.
* Make sure '~~~' '~~~~' '~~~~~' are removed in Nickname preference.
* Rename "ipusuccess" to "unblocked", change the format (now wiki text)
* (bug 2316) Add "caption" attribute to <gallery> tag
* Allow setting the skin object that ImageGallery will use; needed during parse
  operations (the skin must come from the ParserOptions, not $wgUser)
* Fix notice in MacBinary detection debug data for files of certain lengths
* (bug 6131) Add type detection for DjVu files, allowing them to be uploaded
  with validity checking and size detection. No inline thumbnailing yet,
  but could be added in the future.
* (bug 6423) Don't update newtalk flag if page content didn't change (null edits
  were causing the newtalk flag to trigger inappropriately)
* Parser functions are now set using magic words.
* (bug 6428) Incorrect form action URL on Special:Newimages with hidebots = 0 set
* (bug 4990) Show page source to blocked users on edits, or their modified version

* Allow fetching all revisions from transwiki Special:Import
* Allow fetching all revisions from Special:Export GET request

  the MySQL Database class. This may fix some rare breakage with binary fields.
  Note that MediaWiki does not support the multibyte character sets where a
  "dumb" byte replacement can be actively dangerous; UTF-8 is always safe
  in this regard due to the bit patterns which make head and tail bytes
  distinct.

* (bug 6485) Update to Indonesian translation (id) #24

=== Caveats ===

Some output, particularly involving user-supplied inline HTML, may not
produce 100% valid or well-formed XHTML output. Testers are welcome to
set $wgMimeType = "application/xhtml+xml"; to test for remaining problem
cases, but this is not recommended on live sites. (This must be set for
MathML to display properly in Mozilla.)
