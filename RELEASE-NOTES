  and if that's null, then nothing is shown.

  to debugging issues. (Keep this?)

  http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-l/2006-January/033660.html
* Small changes to tabs in Monobook skin c/o Chris Ware

* (bug 4119) Workaround for <nowiki> following link in Walloon; remove capitals
  from linktrail, as they're not used anywhere else.

  save the normalization for internal link storage. The normalization is a bit
  buggy and can make incorrect foldings in the query string and such, so isn't
  reliable beyond the hostname where it's used for the spam bulk checker.

=== Caveats ===

Some output, particularly involving user-supplied inline HTML, may not
produce 100% valid or well-formed XHTML output. Testers are welcome to
set $wgMimeType = "application/xhtml+xml"; to test for remaining problem
cases, but this is not recommended on live sites. (This must be set for
MathML to display properly in Mozilla.)
