= MediaWiki release notes =

Security reminder: MediaWiki does not require PHP's register_globals
setting since version 1.2.0. If you have it on, turn it *off* if you can.

== MediaWiki 1.12 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki is now using a "continuous integration" development model with
quarterly snapshot releases. The latest development code is always kept
"ready to run", and in fact runs our own sites on Wikipedia.

Release branches will continue to receive security updates for about a year
from first release, but nonessential bugfixes and feature developments
will be made on the development trunk and appear in the next quarterly release.

Those wishing to use the latest code instead of a branch release can obtain
it from source control: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Download_from_SVN

=== Configuration changes in 1.12 ===
* Marking edits as bot edits with Special:Contributions?bot=1 now requires the
  markbotedit permission, rather than the rollback permission previously used.
  This permission is assigned by default to the sysop group.
* MediaWiki now checks if serialized files are out of date. New configuration
  variable $wgCheckSerialized can be set to false to enable old behavior (i.e.
  to not check and assume they are always up to date)

=== New features in 1.12 ===
* (bug 10735) Add a warning for non-descriptive filenames at Special:Upload
* Add {{filepath:}} parser function to get full path to an uploaded file,
  complementing {{fullurl:}} for pages.
* (bug 11136) If using Postgres, search path is explicitly set if wgDBmwschema 
  is not set to 'mediawiki', allowing multiple mediawiki instances per user.
* (bug 11151) Add descriptive <title> to revision history page
* (bug 5412) Add feed links for the site to all pages
* (bug 11353) Add ability to retrieve raw section content via action=raw

  source" tab entirely if the page doesn't exist and the user isn't allowed to
  create it

* isValidEmailAddr hook added to User method of that name, to allow, e.g., re-
  stricting e-mail addresses to a specific domain

  on Special:Newpages
* LogLine hook added to allow formatting custom entries in Special:Log.

* Provide a unique message (ipb_blocked_as_range) if unblock of a single IP 
  fails 
  because it is part of a blocked range.
* (bug 3973) Use a separate message for the email content when an account is 
  created by another user
* dumpTextPass.php can spawn fetchText.php as a subprocess, which should restart
  cleanly if database connections fail unpleasantly.
* (bug 12028) Add Special:Listbots as shortcut for Special:Listusers/bot
* (bug 9633) Add a predefined list of delete reasons to the deletion form
* Show a warning message when creating/editing a user (talk) page but the user

== Parser changes in 1.12 ==

The parser pass order has changed from

   * Extension tag strip and render
   * HTML normalisation and security
   * Template expansion
   * Main section...

to 

   * Template and extension tag parse to intermediate representation
   * Template expansion and extension rendering
   * HTML normalisation and security
   * Main section...

The main effect of this for the user is that the rules for uncovered syntax 
have changed. 

Uncovered main-pass syntax, such as HTML tags, are now generally valid, whereas
previously in some cases they were escaped. For example, you could have "<ta" in
one template, and "ble>" in another template, and put them together to make a
valid <table> tag. Previously the result would have been "&lt;table&gt;". 

Uncovered preprocessor syntax is generally not recognised. For example, if you
have "{{a" in Template:A and "b}}" in Template:B, then "{{a}}{{b}}" will be
converted to a literal "{{ab}}" rather than the contents of Template:Ab. This
was the case previously in HTML output mode, and is now uniformly the case in 
the other modes as well. HTML-style comments uncovered by template expansion
will not be recognised by the preprocessor and hence will not prevent template
expansion within them, but they will be stripped by the following HTML security 
pass.

The rules for template expansion during message transformation were
counterintuitive, mostly accidental and buggy. There are a few small changes in
this version: for example, templates with dynamic names, as in "{{ {{a}} }}",
are fully expanded as they are in HTML mode, whereas previously only the inner
template was expanded. I'd like to make some larger breaking changes to message
transformation, after a review of typical use cases.

The header identification routines for section edit and for numbering section
edit links have been merged. This removes a significant failure mode and fixes a
whole category of bugs (tracked by bug #4899). Wikitext headings uncovered by
template expansion or comment removal will still be rendered into a heading tag,
and will get an entry in the TOC, but will not have a section edit link. 
HTML-style headings will also not have a section edit link. Valid wikitext
headings present in the template source text will get a template section edit 
link. This is a major break from previous behaviour, but I believe the effects 
are almost entirely beneficial.

The main motivation for making these changes was performance. The new two-pass
preprocessor can skip "dead branches" in template expansion, such as unfollowed
#switch cases and unused defaults for template arguments. This provides a
significant performance improvement in template-heavy test cases taken from 
Wikipedia. Parser function hooks can participate in this performance improvement
by using the new SFH_OBJECT_ARGS flag during registration.

The pre-expand include size limit has been removed, since there's no efficient
way to calculate such a figure, and it would now be meaningless for performance
anyway. The "preprocessor node count" takes its place, with a generous default
limit.

The context in which XML-style extension tags are called has changed, so
extensions which make use of the parser state may need compatibility changes.

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.12 requires PHP 5 (5.1 recommended). PHP 4 is no longer supported.

PHP 5.0.x fails on 64-bit systems due to serious bugs with array processing:
http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=34879
Upgrade affected systems to PHP 5.1 or higher.

MySQL 3.23.x is no longer supported; some older hosts may need to upgrade.
At this time we still recommend 4.0, but 4.1/5.0 will work fine in most cases.


== Upgrading ==

1.12 has several database changes since 1.11, and will not work without schema
updates.

If upgrading from before 1.7, you may want to run refreshLinks.php to ensure
new database fields are filled with data.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, some major database
changes are made, and there is a slightly higher chance that things could
break. Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.


=== Caveats ===

Some output, particularly involving user-supplied inline HTML, may not
produce 100% valid or well-formed XHTML output. Testers are welcome to
set $wgMimeType = "application/xhtml+xml"; to test for remaining problem
cases, but this is not recommended on live sites. (This must be set for
MathML to display properly in Mozilla.)

For notes on 1.11.x and older releases, see HISTORY.


=== Online documentation ===

Documentation for both end-users and site administrators is currently being
built up on MediaWiki.org, and is covered under the GNU Free Documentation
License (except for pages that explicitly state that their contents are in
the public domain) :

  http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Documentation


=== Mailing list ===

A MediaWiki-l mailing list has been set up distinct from the Wikipedia
wikitech-l list:

  http://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-l

A low-traffic announcements-only list is also available:

  http://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-announce

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.


=== IRC help ===

There's usually someone online in #mediawiki on irc.freenode.net
