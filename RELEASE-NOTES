= MediaWiki release notes =

Security reminder: MediaWiki does not require PHP's register_globals
setting since version 1.2.0. If you have it on, turn it *off* if you can.


*** COMMITTERS! Before 1.4 release, make sure 1.3.x release notes are
*** up to date in the file HISTORY. Don't put 1.3 updates here please.

== MediaWiki 1.4 PRE-ALPHA ==

Major changes from 1.3.x:
* (?) Support for table prefixes for better sharing with other web apps
* (?) PostgreSQL support
* Optional article validation voting features
* 'Recentchanges Patrol' to mark new edits that haven't yet been viewed
* Support for faster C++ diff module (WikiDiff extension)
* More scary link caching modes
* Old manually maintained log pages replaced with searchable Special:Log
* Skins system more modular: templates and CSS are now in /skins/
* ... and more!

=== Caveats ===

Some output, particularly involving user-supplied inline HTML, may not
produce 100% valid or well-formed XHTML output. Testers are welcome to
set $wgMimeType = "application/xhtml+xml"; to test for remaining problem
cases, but this is not recommended on live sites. (This must be set for
MathML to display properly in Mozilla.)

The new 'MonoBook' skin is not compatible with PHP 5 due to bugs in the
underlying PHPTAL library. It will be automatically disabled when running
on PHP5; the older look and feel will be used instead.


For notes on 1.3.x and older releases, see HISTORY.
