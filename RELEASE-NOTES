= MediaWiki release notes =

Security reminder: MediaWiki does not require PHP's register_globals
setting since version 1.2.0. If you have it on, turn it *off* if you can.

== MediaWiki 1.9 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET.

MediaWiki is now using a "continuous integration" development model with
quarterly snapshot releases. The latest development code is always kept
"ready to run", and in fact runs our own sites on Wikipedia.

Release branches will continue to receive security updates for about a year
from first release, but nonessential bugfixes and feature development happen
will be made on the development trunk and appear in the next quarterly release.

Those wishing to use the latest code instead of a branch release can obtain
it from source control: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Download_from_SVN

  compare changes against the previous run.
  Additional tables 'testrun' and 'testitem' are in maintenance/testRunner.sql,
  source this and pass --record option to parserTests.php
* Make the set of default parser test input files extensible via
  $wgParserTestFiles. This can now be appended to by extensions or local
  configuration files so that extension or custom tests can be automatically
  run along with the main batch.
* Run PHP install version checks on update.php so command-line updaters see
  new version requirements
* Do a check for the PHP 5.0.x 64-bit bug, since this is much more disruptive
  as of MW 1.8 than it used to be. Install or upgrade now aborts with a
  warning and a request to upgrade.
* (bug 6440) Updated indexes to improve backlinking queries (links, templates, images)
* Switched 'anon-only' block mode to default for IP blocks
* (bug 3687, 7892) Add distinct heading for media files in category display,

  and user JS subpages.
* (bug 7918) "Templates used on this page" changes during preview to reflect
  any added or removed templates, and works as expected for section edits.

* (bug 7688) When viewing diff, section anchors in autosummary jump to section
  on current page instead of loading the latest version.
* (bug 7970) Use current connection explicitly on Database::getServerVersion
* (bug 2001) Tables with class="sortable" can now be dynamically sorted via
  JavaScript.
* Added autosummary for new pages with 500 or less characters, and refactor
   the autosummary code so it's all done in one function. doEdit is getting too
   big!
* (bug 7554) The correct MIME type for SVG images is now displayed on the
  image page (image/svg+xml, not image/svg).
* (bug 7883) Added autoblock whitelisting feature, using which specific ranges
   can be protected from autoblocking. These ranges are specified, in list format,
   in the autoblock_whitelist system message.

* (bug 8009) Automatic edit summary for redirects is not filled for edits in existing pages
* Installer support for experimental MySQL 4.1/5.0 binary-safe schema

  member variable for text injection into the form, which can be filled by the hooks.
* (bug 6295) Add a "revision patching" functionality, where an edit can be undone
  (with a functionality similar to diff rev1 rev2 | patch -R rev3 -o rev3).
  This is triggered by including &undo=revid in an edit URL. A link to a URL
  that will undo a given edit is shown on NEW NON-CURRENT revision headers on diff pages.
* Fix display of link in "already rolled back" message for image/category pages
* (bug 6016) Left-aligned images should stack vertically, like right-aligned
  images, not horizontally.
* Patch from LeonWP: added UploadForm:BeforeProcessing hook in SpecialUpload.php
* Add AuthPluginSetup hook to override $wgAuth after configuration
* Fix regression in authentication hook auto-creation on login
* (bug 8110) Allow spaces in ISBNs
* (bug 8024) Introduce "send me copies of emails I send to others" preference
* Added 'EditPage::attemptSave' hook before an article is saved.
* (bug 8083) Applied patch for sk localisation
* Add a backslash character to the edit token, to prevent edits via certain
  broken proxies that mangle such characters in form submissions
* (bug 7461) Allow overwriting pages using importTextFile.php
* (bug 7946) importTextFile.php doesn't perform pre-save transform
* (bug 8117) {{REVISIONTIMESTAMP}} showed weird default if $wgLocalTZoffset set;
  now uses current time for previews and if timestamp can't be loaded from DB
* {{REVISIONTIMESTAMP}} now uses site local timezone instead of user timezone
  to ensure consistent behavior
* {{REVISIONTIMESTAMP}} and friends should now work on non-MySQL backends
* (bug 7671) Observe canonical media namespace prefix in Linker::formatComment
* Added js variable wgCurRevisionId to the output
* (bug 8141) Cleanup of Parser::doTableStuff, patch by AzaTht
* (bug 8042) Make miser mode caching limits settable via $wgQueryCacheLimit
  instead of hardcoding to 1000
* Enable QueryPage classes to override list formatting
* (bug 5485) Show number of intervening revisions in diff view
* (bug 8100) Fix XHTML validity in Taiwanese localization
* Added redirect to section feature. Use it wisely.
* Added a configuration variable allowing the "break out of framesets" feature 
  to be switched on and off ($wgBreakFrames). Off by default.
* Allow Xml::check() $attribs parameter to override 'value' attribute
* DB schema change: added two columns (rc_old_len and rc_new_len) to the recentchanges table to store
  the text lengths before and after the edit
* (bug 1085) Made Special:Recentchanges show the character difference between the changed revisions
* Removed a redundant <strong> tag from diff pages that was causing display issues for some users
* (bug 8203) The keyboard shortcut for "log out" was removed, because users were pressing it
  when they intended to press the shortcut for "preview".
* (bug 8148) Handle non-removable output buffers gracefully when cleaning
  buffers for HTTP 304 responses, StreamFile, and Special:Export.
  Duplicated code merged into wfResetOutputBuffers() and wfClearOutputBuffers()
* Special:AllPages : 'next page' link now point to the first title of the next
  chunk instead of pointing to the last title of current chunk.
* (bug 4673) Special:AllPages : add a 'previous' link (new message 'prevpage')
* (bug 8121) wfRandom() was not between 0 and 1
* Add static method Parser::createAssocArgs($args), so parser functions can
  use the same code to parse arguments as the templates do.
* Change behavior of logins using the temporary e-mailed password (as stored
  in user_newpassword hash field). Instead of just logging in silently and
  leaving the previous user_password field in place indefinitely, the user
  is now prompted to set a new password.
  
  The password-changing form is at Special:Resetpass; currently it's only
  usable for changing from the temporary password during login, but it
  could perhaps be generalized, replacing the subform in preferences.
  
  Once the new password is set successfully, the temporary password is wiped
  so it cannot be used to login a second time, and the login process
  is completed.
* Suppress 'mail new password' button on login form if $wgAuth forbids
  changing user passwords; it wouldn't work very well...
* Consolidate password length checks and $wgAuth manipulation into
  User::setPassword() to avoid duplicate code in different places
  that set passwords.
* User::setPassword() now throws PasswordError exceptions if the password
  is illegal or cannot be set via $wgAuth. These can be caught and a human-
  readable error message displayed by UI code.
* Added Title::isSubpage()
* (bug 8241) Don't consider user pages of User:Foo.css to be CSS subpages
* Set an explicit class on framed thumbnail inner divs and images, changed some 
  CSS to use these instead of using descendent selectors.
* Accept null parameter to User::setPassword() as indicating the password
  field should be cleared to an unusable state. Login will only be possible
  after the password is reset, for instance by e-mail.
* (bug 6394) Invalidate the password set for "by e-mail" account creations
  to avoid accidental empty password creations.
* Made the show change size function work on page moves, page creations, and 
  log entries. Also fixed it in the javascript recentchanges.
* (bug 8239) correctly get 50 new contributions when clicking '(50 next)'
* (bug 2259) Fix old regression where e-mail addresses were no longer
  confirmed on login with mailed password.
* Add a notification about the confirmation mail sent during account
  creation, so people don't immediately go off to request a second one.
* Add a warning on Special:Confirmemail if a code was already sent and has
  not yet expired.
* Add user_editcount field to provide data for heuristics on account use.
  Incremented on edit, with lazy initialization from past revision data.
  Can batch-initialize with maintenance/initEditCount.php (not yet friendly
  to replication environments, this will do all accounts in one query).
* Allow raw SQL subsections in Database::update() SET portion as well as
  for WHERE portion. Handy for increments and such.
* User::getOption now accept a default value to override default user values
  this makes it consistent with WebRequest::get* methods. Corrected code in
  various places accordingly.
* (bug 8264) Fix JavaScript global vars for XHTML mode
* Make $wgSiteNotice value wikitext again, for consistency with editable
  MediaWiki:Sitenotice and MediaWiki:Anonnotice.
* (bug 8044) When redirecting from the canonical name of the special page
  to the localised one, parameters/subpages are omitted
* (bug 8164) Special:Booksources should use GET for form submission
* Rewrite Special:Booksources to clean up interface and remove redundant code
* (bug 7925) Change Special:Allmessages message name filter javascript to be
  a bit more responsive and easier on the CPU
* (bug 4488) Support watching pages on deletion; introduces new user preference
* Minor restructuring of Special:Preferences; "watch pages I edit" and "watch
  pages I create" options now accessible under "Watchlist" options
* (bug 8153) <nowiki> doesn't work in site notice
* (bug 6690) wfMsgNoTrans() transforms messages
* (bug 8274) Wrap edit tools in a <div> with a specified class
* Detect PHP 5.0.x 64-bit bug and abort in WebStart.php; too many things break
  mysteriously otherwise (detection code copied from install-utils.inc)
* (bug 8295) Change handling of <center> tags in doBlockLevels() to match that
  of <div>
* (bug 8110) Make magic ISBN linking stricter: only match ten-digit sequences
  (plus optional ISBN-13 prefix) with no immediately following alphanumeric
  character, disallow multiple consecutive internal redirects
* (bug 2785) Accept optional colon prefix in links when formatting comments
* Don't show "you can view and copy the source of this page" message for
  pages which don't exist
* (bug 8310) Blank line added to top of 'post' when page is blank
* (bug 8109) Template parameters ignored in "recentchangestext"
* Gracefully skip redirect-to-fragment on WebKit versions less than 420;
  it messes up on current versions of Safari but is ok in the latest
  nightlies. Checking the version number will allow it to automatically
  work when new releases of Safari appear.
* Fix regression in thumb styles; size and padding didn't match with
  new arrangement.
* (bug 8333) Fix quick user data update on login password change on
  replication database setups. User data is now pulled from master
  instead of slave in User::loadFromDatabase, ensuring that it is
  fresh and accurate when read and then saved back into cache.
  This was breaking with the Special:Rename operation which
  automatically logs the user in with the new password after changing
  it; pulling from slave meant the record was often not the updated
  one.
* (bug 8335) Set image width to the first valid parameter found.
* (bug 8350) Fix watchlist viewing bug when using Postgres.
* (bug 6603) When warning about invalid file extensions, output the bit
  of the extension we actually checked
* (bug 7669) Drop defaults on BLOB/TEXT columns for better compatibility
  with MySQL's strict mode, often enabled by the Windows installer.
  The defaults are ignored anyway when strict mode is off...
* (bug 7685) Use explicit values for ar_text and ar_flags when deleting,
  for better compatibility with MySQL's strict mode
* Update default interwiki values to reflect changed location of ursine:
* (bug 5411) Remove autopatrol preference
* Users who have the "autopatrol" permission will have their edits marked as
  patrolled automatically
* Users who do not have the "autopatrol" permission will no longer be able
  to mark their own edits as patrolled
* Introduce 'PingLimiter' hook; see docs/hooks.txt for more information
* (bug 532) Tweaked alt text for some interface messages
* (bug 8231) Gave useful alt text to the main <img> on image pages
* (bug 371) Remove alt text for "Enlarge" icon on thumbnails
* Initialize user_editcount to 0 instead of NULL for newly created accounts
* (bug 3696) Strip LRM and RLM characters from titles to work around the
  problem some people have where titles cut-and-pasted from lists include
  the bidi override characters appended to the lists.
  A more thorough blacklist for forbidden and translatable characters would
  be wise, though, as might a cleaner method for the lists in the first place.
* Fix regression in email password resets on read-restricted sites
* Set tabindex on fields in deletion form so you don't have to tab through
  the links in the sitenotice
* (bug 8271) Show full time and date on viewer for individual deleted
  revisions
* (bug 8214) Output file size limit and actual file size in appropriate units
  on Special:Upload
* (bug 8016) Purge objectcache table during upgrade processes - use the --nopurge
  option to prevent this when running maintenance/update.php
* (bug 7612) Remove superfluous link to Special:Categories from result items
  on Special:Mostcategories
* {{PLURAL:}} now handles formatted numbers correctly
* (bug 8331) Added the change size value to watchlists; therefore made
  watchlists use RecentChange::newFromRow() instead of newFromCurRow()
* (bug 8351) Fix undo for simple reverts
* (bug 6856) User::clearNotification() does not respect read-only mode
* (bug 6853) Use a checkbox on the installer form to indicate that a superuser
  account should be used; this is clearer than the old check which relied on
  the password never being an obscure value
* Remove old unused watchlist cache, which was a leftover from the old schema
  where watchlists were more expensive to generate
* Minor cosmetic changes to Special:Userrights
* Added wgCanonicalSpecialPageName to JavaScript variables
* Fix image deleting when using Postgres.
* Output both source and destination titles in maintenance/moveBatch.php
* Added basic parser tests for language variants 
* Enable selflinks and categories to be written in some of the language variants
* Prevent conversion of JavaScript code in language variants
* Output software version number in maintenance/parserTests.php
* (bug 7169) Use Ajax to watch/unwatch articles if enabled
* Make variant table caching a little more robust, using main language code
  in cache key. Probably this is still a bit wonky, though. Was breaking
  parser tests when Chinese tables were getting loaded into Serbian code.
* (bug 8380) Be nicer about blank lines in deleteBatch.php
* (bug 8401) Fix regression in SORBS lookup for some DNS setups
* Use raw file descriptor in posix_isatty() check to avoid warning on
  Linux systems with at least some versions of PHP
* (bug 5908) Allow overriding the default category sort key for all items on
  a page using {{DEFAULTSORT}}
* (bug 6449) Throw a more definitive error message when installation fails
  due to an invalid database name
* (bug 5827) Use full text for option link labels on Special:Watchlist
* (bug 8018) Allow hiding minor edits from the watchlist
* (bug 8427) MonoBook RTL IE 7.0 tweaks failed when sidebar's navigation
  section is renamed; no longer relies on first section name
* Stabilize client-side table sorting even if the underlying Javascript sort()
  implementation is unstable
* Add hook for extensions to add user information to the panel in preferences,
  next to the user name and ID.
* (bug 8392) Display protection status of transcluded pages in the edit page
  template list. Patch by Fyren, with i18n naming tweak.
* Fix for interwiki transclusion where target wiki uses query string for title
* Resolve namespaces on interwiki Title objects using canonical namespace names
  if possible (should not happen, though, outside interwiki transclusion... and
  maybe not even then, but it does)
* (bug 8447) Fix SQL typo breaking non-default $wgHitcounterUpdateFreq
* Do not allow previews of deleted images to be cached
* Add global variable $wgDefaultLanguageVariant used to set the default language 
  variant of a wiki to something different than the main language code
* Add 'variant' option to parserTests - runs test with the given variant as 
  preferred, utilize it for more parser tests of language variants code
* (bug 6503) Fix bug that stopped certain irrelevant links from being hidden
  for printing
* Avoid PHP warning in Creative Commons metadata when a creative commons
  license is not actually set up
* (bug 8463) Don't print external link icons for Monobook
* (bug 8461) Support watching pages on move

  loaded by skipping the function. Use wfDebugBacktrace() wrapper function.
* Reduce config file clutter by setting various script and upload paths
  based on $IP or $wgScriptPath in Setup.php. They can still be explicitly
  overridden in LocalSettings.php if desired...
* Attempt to detect redirect loops for the canonical title redirect, and
  give some hints to the poor confused administrator.

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.9 requires PHP 5 (5.1 recommended). PHP 4 is no longer supported.

PHP 5.0.x fails on 64-bit systems due to serious bugs with array processing:

Upgrade affected systems to PHP 5.1 or higher.

MySQL 3.23.x is no longer supported; some older hosts may need to upgrade.
At this time we still recommend 4.0, but 4.1/5.0 will work fine in most cases.


== Upgrading ==

Some minor database changes have been made since 1.7:
* new fields and indexes on ipblocks
* index change on recentchanges

Several changes from 1.5 and 1.6 do require updates to be run on upgrade.
To ensure that these tables are filled with data, run refreshLinks.php after
the upgrade.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, some major database
changes are made, and there is a slightly higher chance that things could
break. Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.



=== Caveats ===

Some output, particularly involving user-supplied inline HTML, may not
produce 100% valid or well-formed XHTML output. Testers are welcome to
set $wgMimeType = "application/xhtml+xml"; to test for remaining problem
cases, but this is not recommended on live sites. (This must be set for
MathML to display properly in Mozilla.)


For notes on 1.5.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

=== Mailing list ===

A MediaWiki-l mailing list has been set up distinct from the Wikipedia
wikitech-l list:

  http://mail.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-l

A low-traffic announcements-only list is also available:

  http://mail.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-announce

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.


=== IRC help ===

There's usually someone online in #mediawiki on irc.freenode.net
