= MediaWiki release notes =

Security reminder: MediaWiki does not require PHP's register_globals
setting since version 1.2.0. If you have it on, turn it *off* if you can.

== MediaWiki 1.18 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki is now using a "continuous integration" development model with
quarterly snapshot releases. The latest development code is always kept
"ready to run", and in fact runs our own sites on Wikipedia.

Release branches will continue to receive security updates for about a year
from first release, but nonessential bugfixes and feature developments
will be made on the development trunk and appear in the next quarterly release.

Those wishing to use the latest code instead of a branch release can obtain
it from source control: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Download_from_SVN

=== PHP 5.2 now required ==
In 1.18, the lowest supported version of MediaWiki is now 5.2.x. Please upgrade
PHP if you have not done so prior to upgrading MediaWiki.

=== Configuration changes in 1.18 ===
* The WantedPages::getSQL hook has been removed and replaced with
  WantedPages::getQueryInfo . This may break older extensions.
* $wgUseCombinedLoginLink controls whether to output a combined
  login / create account link in the personal bar, or to output separate login
  and create account links
* Skin names are no longer created based on a ucfirst version of the key in
  $wgValidSkinNames but now the value. This means for
  $wgValidSkinNames["monobook"] = "MonoBook"; the skin loader will no longer try
  loading SkinMonobook and will instead load SkinMonoBook.
* The parser now attempts to output markers for editsection tokens and defer the
  rendering of them so skin and language specific markup does not need to be
  saved inside the parser cache note that this changes the cache key making all
  old entries in the parser cache invalid you can set $wgUseEditSectionTokens to
  false to disable this and keep your old parser cache entries.
  Note that this feature should reduce parser cache fragmentation when enabled.
* $wgMaxUploadSize may now be set to an array to specify the upload size limit
  per upload type.
* $wgAPICacheHelp added in 1.16 is now removed. To disable API help caching, set
  $wgAPICacheHelpTimeout = 0;
* OutputPage::isUserJsAllowed() no longer returns false when scripts are allowed
  by the page, but $wgAllowUserJs is set to false.
* Pure "Skin" class based custom skins are no longer supported, all custom skins
  should be put together using SkinTemplate and BaseTemplate or QuickTemplate.
* The transliteration for passwords in case they were migrated from an old Latin-1
  install (previous to MediaWiki 1.5) is now only done for wikis with
  $wgLegacyEncoding set.

=== New features in 1.18 ===
* Added a special page, disabled by default, that allows users with the
  'disableaccount' privilege to permanently deactivate user accounts.
* (bug 8130) Query pages should limit to content namespaces, not just main
  namespace
* Search suggestions (other than in the Vector skin) will now use the HTML5
  datalist feature where supported, currently only Firefox 4.

  This only affects thumbnails; the source remains unrotated.
* (bug 25708) Update case mappings and normalization to Unicode 6.0.0
* New hook ArticlePrepareTextForEdit added, called when preparing text to be
  saved.

  to be selectively disabled.

  thumbnail.

* (bug 24230) Uploads of ZIP types, such as MS Office or OpenOffice can now be
  safely enabled. A ZIP file reader was added which can scan a ZIP file for
  potentially dangerous Java applets. This allows applets to be blocked
  specifically, rather than all ZIP files being blocked.
* (bug 2429) Allow selection of associated namespace in recent changes
* (bug 26995) File size is now checked before uploading in HTML5 browsers

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.18 requires PHP 5.1 (5.2 recommended). PHP 4 is no longer
supported.

MySQL 3.23.x is no longer supported; some older hosts may need to upgrade.
At this time we still recommend 4.0, but 4.1/5.0 will work fine in most cases.


== Upgrading ==

1.18 has several database changes since 1.17, and will not work without schema
updates.

If upgrading from before 1.11, and you are using a wiki as a commons reposito-
ry, make sure that it is updated as well. Otherwise, errors may arise due to
database schema changes.

If upgrading from before 1.7, you may want to run refreshLinks.php to ensure
new database fields are filled with data.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, some major database
changes are made, and there is a slightly higher chance that things could
break. Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.


=== Caveats ===

Some output, particularly involving user-supplied inline HTML, may not
produce 100% valid or well-formed XHTML output. Testers are welcome to
set $wgMimeType = "application/xhtml+xml"; to test for remaining problem
cases, but this is not recommended on live sites. (This must be set for
MathML to display properly in Mozilla.)

For notes on 1.17.x and older releases, see HISTORY.


=== Online documentation ===

Documentation for both end-users and site administrators is currently being
built up on MediaWiki.org, and is covered under the GNU Free Documentation
License (except for pages that explicitly state that their contents are in
the public domain) :

	http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Documentation


=== Mailing list ===

A MediaWiki-l mailing list has been set up distinct from the Wikipedia
wikitech-l list:

	http://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-l

A low-traffic announcements-only list is also available:

	http://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-announce

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.


=== IRC help ===

There's usually someone online in #mediawiki on irc.freenode.net
