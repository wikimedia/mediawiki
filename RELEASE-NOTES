= MediaWiki release notes =

Security reminder: MediaWiki does not require PHP's register_globals
setting since version 1.2.0. If you have it on, turn it *off* if you can.

== MediaWiki 1.16 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki is now using a "continuous integration" development model with
quarterly snapshot releases. The latest development code is always kept
"ready to run", and in fact runs our own sites on Wikipedia.

Release branches will continue to receive security updates for about a year
from first release, but nonessential bugfixes and feature developments
will be made on the development trunk and appear in the next quarterly release.

Those wishing to use the latest code instead of a branch release can obtain
it from source control: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Download_from_SVN

=== Configuration changes in 1.16 ===  

* $wgEnableFirefogg enable support for firefogg extension, firefogg supports 
in-browser transcoding, chunk uploads and client side hash checking. 
* $wgEnableTemporalOggUrls enable oggz_chop support a server side ogg seeking
helper 
* $wgEnableScriptLoader if the script-loader shoudl be enabled
* $wgJSAutoloadClasses array of javascript classes to file paths used by
script-loader to load javascript by class name. 
* $wgEnableJS2system  if we should include js2 stuff like jquery, 
mv_embed.js (script-loader helper) and use new interfaces for upload
* $wgEnableScriptLoaderJsFile if we support grabbing js files with the script
loader. By default we only grab classes in $wgJSAutoloadClasses
* $wgEnableScriptMinify if you want the script loader to minify js
* $wgEnableScriptLocalization if you want the script loader to do msg lookups
* $wgMwEmbedDirectory the path to MwEmbed Directory (maybe we can depreciate
this. Was used when mwEmbed was going to be an extension.   
* $wgDebugJavaScript if we want to enable fresh debug javascript 
* $wgPhpCliPath Path to php-cli for spinning up background php processes
* (bug 18222) $wgMinimalPasswordLength default is now 1
* $wgSessionHandler can be used to configure session.save_handler
* $wgLocalFileRepo/$wgForeignFileRepos now have a 'fileMode' parameter to
  be used when uploading/moving files
* (bug 18761) $wgHiddenPrefs is a new array for specifying preferences not
  to be shown to users
* $wgAllowRealName and $wgAllowUserSkin were deprecated in favor of
  $wgHiddenPrefs[] = 'realname', but the former are still retained
  for backwards-compatibility
* (bug 9257) $wgRCMaxAge now defaults to three months
* $wgDevelopmentWarnings can be set to true to show warnings about deprecated
  functions and other potential errors when developing.
* Subpages are now enabled in the MediaWiki namespace by default.  This is
  mainly a cosmetic change, and does not in any way affect the MessageCache,
  which was already effectively treating the namespace as if it had subpages.
* (bug 10837) $wgVariant is a user variant selected in the user's preferences
  if the $wgContLang does not have variant, then the $wgLang is used instead.
* Oracle: maintenance/ora/user.sql script for creating DB user on oracle with
  appropriate privileges. Creating this user with web-install page requires
  oci8.privileged_connect set to On in php.ini.
* Removed UserrightsChangeableGroups hook introduced in 1.14
* Added $wgCacheDirectory, to replace $wgFileCacheDirectory, 
  $wgLocalMessageCache, and any other local caches which need a place to put 
  files. 
* $wgFileCacheDirectory is no longer set to anything by default, and so either
  needs to be set explicitly, or $wgCacheDirectory needs to be set instead. 
* $wgLocalMessageCache has been removed. Instead, set $wgUseLocalMessageCache
  to true
* Removed $wgEnableSerializedMessages and $wgCheckSerialized. Similar 
  functionality is now available via $wgLocalisationCacheConf.
* $wgMessageCache->addMessages() is deprecated. Messages added via this 
  interface will not appear in Special:AllMessages.
* $wgRegisterInternalExternals can be used to record external links pointing 
  to same server
* $wgSpecialVersionExtended shows the extended version information besides 
  PHP and database version.
* $wgSecondaryGoNamespaces allows an arry of namespaces to be checked when the
  GO button is pressed, in addition to the main namespace.
* (bug 19907) $wgCrossSiteAJAXdomains and $wgCrossSiteAJAXdomainsRegex added 
  to control which external domains may access the API via cross-site AJAX.
* $wgMaintenanceScripts for extensions to add their scripts to the default list
* $wgMemoryLimit has been added, default value '50M'
* $wgExtraRandompageSQL is deprecated, the SpecialRandomBeforeSQL hook should
  be used instead

=== New features in 1.16 ===

* (bug 17163) Added MediaWiki:Talkpageheader which will be displayed when
  viewing talk pages

  to Special:Version

  the DBA extension is not available.
* (bug 14611) Added support showing the version of the web server, image 
  thumbnailing engine, diff/diff3 engine and TeX engine, enabled for sysops 
  by default.
* Introduced a new system for localisation caching. The system is based around 
  fast fetches of individual messages, minimising memory overhead and startup 
  time in the typical case. The database backend will be used by default, but 
  set $wgCacheDirectory to get a faster CDB-based implementation.
* Expanded the number of variables which can be set in the extension messages 
  files.
* Added a feature to allow per-article process pool size control for the parsing 
  task, to limit resource usage when the cache for a heavily-viewed article is
  invalidated. Requires an external daemon.

* (bug 15209) New hook BeforeInitialize called after everything has been setup
  but before Mediawiki::performRequestForTitle()
* wgMainPageTitle variable now available to JavaScript code to identify the main
  page link, so it doesn't have to be extracted from the link URLs.

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.16 requires PHP 5 (5.2 recommended). PHP 4 is no longer supported.

PHP 5.0.x fails on 64-bit systems due to serious bugs with array processing:
http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=34879
Upgrade affected systems to PHP 5.1 or higher.

MySQL 3.23.x is no longer supported; some older hosts may need to upgrade.
At this time we still recommend 4.0, but 4.1/5.0 will work fine in most cases.


== Upgrading ==

1.16 has several database changes since 1.15, and will not work without schema
updates.

If upgrading from before 1.11, and you are using a wiki as a commons reposito-
ry, make sure that it is updated as well. Otherwise, errors may arise due to
database schema changes.

If upgrading from before 1.7, you may want to run refreshLinks.php to ensure
new database fields are filled with data.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, some major database
changes are made, and there is a slightly higher chance that things could
break. Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.


=== Caveats ===

Some output, particularly involving user-supplied inline HTML, may not
produce 100% valid or well-formed XHTML output. Testers are welcome to
set $wgMimeType = "application/xhtml+xml"; to test for remaining problem
cases, but this is not recommended on live sites. (This must be set for
MathML to display properly in Mozilla.)

For notes on 1.15.x and older releases, see HISTORY.


=== Online documentation ===

Documentation for both end-users and site administrators is currently being
built up on MediaWiki.org, and is covered under the GNU Free Documentation
License (except for pages that explicitly state that their contents are in
the public domain) :

  http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Documentation


=== Mailing list ===

A MediaWiki-l mailing list has been set up distinct from the Wikipedia
wikitech-l list:

  http://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-l

A low-traffic announcements-only list is also available:

  http://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-announce

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.


=== IRC help ===

There's usually someone online in #mediawiki on irc.freenode.net
