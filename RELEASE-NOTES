= MediaWiki release notes =

Security reminder: MediaWiki does not require PHP's register_globals
setting since version 1.2.0. If you have it on, turn it *off* if you can.

== MediaWiki 1.13 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki is now using a "continuous integration" development model with
quarterly snapshot releases. The latest development code is always kept
"ready to run", and in fact runs our own sites on Wikipedia.

Release branches will continue to receive security updates for about a year
from first release, but nonessential bugfixes and feature developments
will be made on the development trunk and appear in the next quarterly release.

Those wishing to use the latest code instead of a branch release can obtain
it from source control: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Download_from_SVN

=== Configuration changes in 1.13 ===

* New option $wgFeed can be set false to turn off syndication feeds

  links through each redirect instead of hardcoded 500

  in your LocalSettings.php.
* (bug 2396) New shared database configuration variables. $wgSharedPrefix allows
  you to use a shared database with a different prefix. Or you can now use a local
  database and use prefixes to separate wiki and the shared tables. And the new
  $wgSharedTables variable allows you to specify a list of tables to share.
* Automatic edit summaries can be disabled with $wgUseAutomaticEditSummaries  
* Duplicates of images are now shown on the image page
* $wgRCFilterByAge allows for the list of dates in recent changes special pages to
  be filtered to only those within the range of $wgRCMaxAge

  displayed on the recent changes special pages
* The "createpage" permission is no longer required when uploading if the target
  image page already exists
* $wgMaximumMovedPages restricts the number of pages that can be moved at once
  (default 100) with the new subpage-move functionality of Special:Movepage
* Hooks display in Special:Version is now disabled by default, use 
  $wgSpecialVersionShowHooks = true; to enable it.
* $wgActiveUserEditCount sets the number of edits that must be performed over
  a certain number of days to be considered active
* $wgActiveUserDays is that number of days
* $wgRateLimitsExcludedGroups has been deprecated in favor of 
  $wgGroupPermissions[]['noratelimit']. The former still works, however.

=== New features in 1.13 ===

=== Languages updated in 1.13 ===

MediaWiki supports over 300 languages. Many localisations are updated
regularly. Below only new and removed languages are listed.

* Egyptian Spoken Arabic (arz) (new)
* Middle Dutch (dum) (removed)
* British English (en-gb) (new)
* Fiji Hindi (Latin) (hif-latn) (new)
* Old Norse (non) (removed)
* Serbian cyrillic iyekvian (sr-jc) (removed)
* Serbian latin iyekavian (sr-jl) (removed)
* Silesian (szl) (new)
* Tajiki (Cyrllic script) (tg-cyrl) (new)

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.13 requires PHP 5 (5.1 recommended). PHP 4 is no longer supported.

PHP 5.0.x fails on 64-bit systems due to serious bugs with array processing:
http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=34879
Upgrade affected systems to PHP 5.1 or higher.

MySQL 3.23.x is no longer supported; some older hosts may need to upgrade.
At this time we still recommend 4.0, but 4.1/5.0 will work fine in most cases.


== Upgrading ==

1.13 has several database changes since 1.12, and will not work without schema
updates.

If upgrading from before 1.7, you may want to run refreshLinks.php to ensure
new database fields are filled with data.

If upgrading from before 1.11, and you are using a wiki as a commons repository,
make sure that it is updated as well. Otherwise, errors may arise due to
database schema changes.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, some major database
changes are made, and there is a slightly higher chance that things could
break. Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.


=== Caveats ===

Some output, particularly involving user-supplied inline HTML, may not
produce 100% valid or well-formed XHTML output. Testers are welcome to
set $wgMimeType = "application/xhtml+xml"; to test for remaining problem
cases, but this is not recommended on live sites. (This must be set for
MathML to display properly in Mozilla.)

=== Online documentation ===

Documentation for both end-users and site administrators is currently being
built up on MediaWiki.org, and is covered under the GNU Free Documentation
License (except for pages that explicitly state that their contents are in
the public domain) :

  http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Documentation


=== Mailing list ===

A MediaWiki-l mailing list has been set up distinct from the Wikipedia
wikitech-l list:

  http://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-l

A low-traffic announcements-only list is also available:

  http://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-announce

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.


=== IRC help ===

There's usually someone online in #mediawiki on irc.freenode.net
