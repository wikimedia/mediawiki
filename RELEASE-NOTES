= MediaWiki release notes =

Security reminder: MediaWiki does not require PHP's register_globals
setting since version 1.2.0. If you have it on, turn it *off* if you can.

== MediaWiki 1.18 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki is now using a "continuous integration" development model with
quarterly snapshot releases. The latest development code is always kept
"ready to run", and in fact runs our own sites on Wikipedia.

Release branches will continue to receive security updates for about a year
from first release, but nonessential bugfixes and feature developments
will be made on the development trunk and appear in the next quarterly release.

Those wishing to use the latest code instead of a branch release can obtain
it from source control: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Download_from_SVN

=== PHP 5.2 now required ==
In 1.18, the lowest supported version of MediaWiki is now 5.2.3. Please upgrade
PHP if you have not done so prior to upgrading MediaWiki.

=== Configuration changes in 1.18 ===
* The WantedPages::getSQL hook has been removed and replaced with
  WantedPages::getQueryInfo . This may break older extensions.
* $wgUseCombinedLoginLink controls whether to output a combined
  login / create account link in the personal bar, or to output separate login
  and create account links
* Skin names are no longer created based on a ucfirst version of the key in
  $wgValidSkinNames but now the value. This means for
  $wgValidSkinNames["monobook"] = "MonoBook"; the skin loader will no longer try
  loading SkinMonobook and will instead load SkinMonoBook.
* $wgMaxUploadSize may now be set to an array to specify the upload size limit
  per upload type.
* $wgAPICacheHelp added in 1.16 is now removed. To disable API help caching, set
  $wgAPICacheHelpTimeout = 0;
* OutputPage::isUserJsAllowed() no longer returns false when scripts are allowed
  by the page, but $wgAllowUserJs is set to false.
* Pure "Skin" class based custom skins are no longer supported, all custom skins
  should be put together using SkinTemplate and BaseTemplate or QuickTemplate.
* The transliteration for passwords in case they were migrated from an old Latin-1
  install (previous to MediaWiki 1.5) is now only done for wikis with
  $wgLegacyEncoding set.
* (bug 27508) Add $wgSVGMetadataCutoff to limit the maximum amount of an svg we
  look at when finding metadata to prevent excessive resource usage.
* $wgSysopUserBans and $wgSysopRangeBans (deprecated in 1.17) are now removed.
  Use $wgBlockCIDRLimit = array( 'IPv4' => 43, 'IPv6' => 128 ) to achieve the same
  functionality as $wgSysopRangeBans; you can use the BlockIp hook to replicate
  $wgSysopUserBans functionality.
* The options on the block form have been standardised such that checking a box
  makes the block 'more serious'; so while "check to prevent account creation" and
  "check to enable autoblock" remain the same, "check to allow user-talk edit" is
  reversed to "check to *disable* user-talk edit", and "check to block anon-only"
  becomes "check to block logged-in users too".  The default settings remain the same.
* Most of the field names on the Special:Block form have been changed, which will
  probably break screen-scraping bots.
* (bug 26866) The 'trackback' right is no longer granted to sysops by default.
  $wgUseTrackbacks is already false by default

=== New features in 1.18 ===
* Added a special page, disabled by default, that allows users with the
  'disableaccount' privilege to permanently deactivate user accounts.
* (bug 8130) Query pages should limit to content namespaces, not just main
  namespace
* Search suggestions (other than in the Vector skin) will now use the HTML5
  datalist feature where supported, currently only Firefox 4.
* Special:Contribs now redirects to Special:Contributions
* (bug 6672) Images are now autorotated according to their EXIF orientation.
  This only affects thumbnails; the source remains unrotated.
* (bug 25708) Update case mappings and normalization to Unicode 6.0.0
* New hook ArticlePrepareTextForEdit added, called when preparing text to be
  saved.
* New parser option PreSaveTransform added, allows the pre-save transformation
  to be selectively disabled.
* Alternative to $wgHooks implemented, using the new Hooks class.
* Add width parameter to Special:Filepath to allow getting the file path of a
  thumbnail.
* (bug 26870) Add size to {{filepath:}}
* Upload warnings now show a thumbnail of the uploaded file
* Introduced the edittools-upload message, which will be inserted under the
  upload form instead of edittools if available
* (bug 26285) Extensions will be automatically generated on upload if the user
  specified a filename without extension.
* (bug 26851) Special:UserRights now allows to prefill the reason field
* New maintenance script to fix double redirects
  (maintenance/fixDoubleRedirects.php)
* (bug 23315) New body classes to allow easier styling of special pages
* (bug 27159) Make email confirmation code expiration time configurable
* CSS/JS for each user group is imported from MediaWiki:Sysop.js,
  MediaWiki:Autoconfirmed.css, etc.
* (bug 24230) Uploads of ZIP types, such as MS Office or OpenOffice can now be
  safely enabled. A ZIP file reader was added which can scan a ZIP file for
  potentially dangerous Java applets. This allows applets to be blocked
  specifically, rather than all ZIP files being blocked.
* (bug 2429) Allow selection of associated namespace in recent changes
* (bug 26217) File size is now checked before uploading in HTML5 browsers
* CSS stylesheet MediaWiki:Noscript.css is now loaded for users with JavaScript
  disabled (enclosed in the head in a <noscript> tag)
* Added UserGetLanguageObject hook to change the language used in $wgLang
* (bug 14645) When $wgMiserMode is on, expensive special pages are styled
  differently (italicized by default) on Special:SpecialPages
* Added $wgAggregateStatsID, which allows UDP stats to be aggregated over
  several wikis.
* When $wgAllowMicrodataAttributes is true, all itemtypes are allowed, not just
  the three that were defined in the original specification.
* (bug 14706) Added support for the Imagick PHP extension.
* (bug 18691) Added support for SVG rasterization using the Imagick PHP 
  extension
* (bug 2581, bug 6834) Added links to thumbnail in several resolutions to the 
  file description page. The sizes are set by $wgImageLimits.
* (bug 28031) Add pageCount support to ArchivedFile
* (bug 27924) PhpHttpRequest doesn't return response body if HTTP != 200
* Added hook BitmapHandlerTransform to allow extension to transform a file 
  without overriding the entire handler.
* The parser now attempts to output markers for editsection tokens and defer the
  rendering of them post-cache to reduce parser cache fragmentation and ensure
  skin customizability of edit section links.

MediaWiki supports over 330 languages. Many localisations are updated
regularly. Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as
changes to languages because of Bugzilla reports.

* Liv (liv) (new)

* (bug 17160) Gender specific display text for User namespace
* Link trail added for sl and sh
* (bug 27633) Add characters to linkTrail for Potuguese (pt and pt-br)

  uppercase 'i' to 'İ' (dotted i)

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.18 requires PHP 5.2.3. PHP 4 is no longer supported.

MySQL 3.23.x is no longer supported; some older hosts may need to upgrade.
At this time we still recommend 4.0, but 4.1/5.0 will work fine in most cases.


== Upgrading ==

1.18 has several database changes since 1.17, and will not work without schema
updates.

If upgrading from before 1.11, and you are using a wiki as a commons reposito-
ry, make sure that it is updated as well. Otherwise, errors may arise due to
database schema changes.

If upgrading from before 1.7, you may want to run refreshLinks.php to ensure
new database fields are filled with data.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, some major database
changes are made, and there is a slightly higher chance that things could
break. Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.


=== Caveats ===

Some output, particularly involving user-supplied inline HTML, may not
produce 100% valid or well-formed XHTML output. Testers are welcome to
set $wgMimeType = "application/xhtml+xml"; to test for remaining problem
cases, but this is not recommended on live sites. (This must be set for
MathML to display properly in Mozilla.)

For notes on 1.17.x and older releases, see HISTORY.


=== Online documentation ===

Documentation for both end-users and site administrators is currently being
built up on MediaWiki.org, and is covered under the GNU Free Documentation
License (except for pages that explicitly state that their contents are in
the public domain) :

	http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Documentation


=== Mailing list ===

A MediaWiki-l mailing list has been set up distinct from the Wikipedia
wikitech-l list:

	http://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-l

A low-traffic announcements-only list is also available:

	http://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-announce

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.


=== IRC help ===

There's usually someone online in #mediawiki on irc.freenode.net
