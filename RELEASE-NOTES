= MediaWiki release notes =

Security reminder: MediaWiki does not require PHP's register_globals
setting since version 1.2.0. If you have it on, turn it *off* if you can.

== MediaWiki 1.7 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET.

MediaWiki is now using a "continuous integration" development model with
quarterly snapshot releases. The latest development code is always kept
"ready to run", and in fact runs our own sites on Wikipedia.

Release branches will continue to receive security updates for about a year
from first release, but nonessential bugfixes and feature development happen
will be made on the development trunk and appear in the next quarterly release.

Those wishing to use the latest code instead of a branch release can obtain
it from source control: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Download_from_SVN

== Configuration changes ==

Some default configuration options have changed:
* $wgAllowExternalImages now defaults to off for increased security.

== Major new features ==

* Deleted files can now be archived and undeleted, if you set up
  an appropriate non-web-accessible directory.
  Set $wgSaveDeletedFiles on and an appropriate directory path in
  $wgFileStore['deleted']['directory']

  could even result in invalid output from valid input. 
* (bug 4280) Use 'noindex,nofollow' instead of 'noindex,follow' for default
  meta robots tag on diff view and special pages. Should reduce impact of

  in this regard due to the bit patterns which make head and tail bytes

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.7 requires PHP 5 (5.1 recommended). PHP 4 is no longer supported.

MySQL 3.23.x is no longer supported; some older hosts may need to upgrade.
At this time we still recommend 4.0, but 4.1/5.0 will work fine in most cases.


== Upgrading ==

Several changes to the database have been made from 1.6:

* A new "langlinks" table tracks interlanguage links
* A new "filearchive" table stores information on deleted files
* A new "querycache_info" table stores information on query page updates

To ensure that these tables are filled with data, run refreshLinks.php after
the upgrade.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, some major database
changes are made, and there is a slightly higher chance that things could
break. Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.



=== Caveats ===

Some output, particularly involving user-supplied inline HTML, may not
produce 100% valid or well-formed XHTML output. Testers are welcome to
set $wgMimeType = "application/xhtml+xml"; to test for remaining problem
cases, but this is not recommended on live sites. (This must be set for
MathML to display properly in Mozilla.)


For notes on 1.5.x and older releases, see HISTORY.
