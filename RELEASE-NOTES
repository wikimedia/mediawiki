= MediaWiki release notes =

Security reminder: MediaWiki does not require PHP's register_globals
setting since version 1.2.0. If you have it on, turn it *off* if you can.

== MediaWiki 1.8 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET.

MediaWiki is now using a "continuous integration" development model with
quarterly snapshot releases. The latest development code is always kept
"ready to run", and in fact runs our own sites on Wikipedia.

Release branches will continue to receive security updates for about a year
from first release, but nonessential bugfixes and feature development happen
will be made on the development trunk and appear in the next quarterly release.

Those wishing to use the latest code instead of a branch release can obtain
it from source control: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Download_from_SVN

== Configuration changes ==

* None yet!


== Major new features ==

* (bug 550) Allow blocks on anonymous users only.

== Changes since 1.7 ==

* (bug 6562) Removed unmaintained ParserXml.php for now
* History paging overlap bug fixed
* (bug 6586) Regression in "unblocked" subtitle
* Don't put empty-page message into view-source when page text is blank
* (bug 6587) Remove redundant "allnonarticles" message
* Block improvements: Allow blocks on anonymous users only. Optionally allow 
  or disallow account creation from blocked IP addresses. Prevent duplicate
  blocks. Fixed the problem of expiry and unblocking erroneously affecting
  multiple blocks. Fixed confusing lack of error message when a blocked user
  attempts to create an account. Fixed inefficiency of Special:Ipblocklist in 
  the presence of large numbers of blocks; added indexes and implemented an 
  indexed pager.
* (bug 6448) Allow filtering of Special:Newpages according to username

* English (en)
* German (de)

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.8 requires PHP 5 (5.1 recommended). PHP 4 is no longer supported.

MySQL 3.23.x is no longer supported; some older hosts may need to upgrade.
At this time we still recommend 4.0, but 4.1/5.0 will work fine in most cases.


== Upgrading ==

Several changes to the database have been made from 1.6:

* A new "langlinks" table tracks interlanguage links
* A new "filearchive" table stores information on deleted files
* A new "querycache_info" table stores information on query page updates

To ensure that these tables are filled with data, run refreshLinks.php after
the upgrade.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, some major database
changes are made, and there is a slightly higher chance that things could
break. Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.



=== Caveats ===

Some output, particularly involving user-supplied inline HTML, may not
produce 100% valid or well-formed XHTML output. Testers are welcome to
set $wgMimeType = "application/xhtml+xml"; to test for remaining problem
cases, but this is not recommended on live sites. (This must be set for
MathML to display properly in Mozilla.)


For notes on 1.5.x and older releases, see HISTORY.


=== Online documentation ===

Documentation for both end-users and site administrators is currently being
built up on Meta-Wikipedia, and is covered under the GNU Free Documentation
License:

=== Mailing list ===

A MediaWiki-l mailing list has been set up distinct from the Wikipedia
wikitech-l list:

  http://mail.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-l

A low-traffic announcements-only list is also available:

  http://mail.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-announce

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.


=== IRC help ===

There's usually someone online in #mediawiki on irc.freenode.net
