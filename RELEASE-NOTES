= MediaWiki release notes =

Security reminder: MediaWiki does not require PHP's register_globals
setting since version 1.2.0. If you have it on, turn it *off* if you can.

== MediaWiki 1.10 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET.

MediaWiki is now using a "continuous integration" development model with
quarterly snapshot releases. The latest development code is always kept
"ready to run", and in fact runs our own sites on Wikipedia.

Release branches will continue to receive security updates for about a year
from first release, but nonessential bugfixes and feature development happen
will be made on the development trunk and appear in the next quarterly release.

Those wishing to use the latest code instead of a branch release can obtain
it from source control: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Download_from_SVN

== Configuration changes ==

=== $wgCommandLineDarkBg ==

A new switch used by maintenance scripts (parserTests.php). It lets you specify
if your terminal use a dark background, the colorized output will be made
lighter making things easier to read.

== Major new features ==

== Changes since 1.9 ==

* New script maintenance/language/checkExtensioni18n.php used to check i18n
  progress in the extension repository.
* Running maintenance/parserTests.php with '--record' option, will now
  automatically attempt to create the required tables

* Introduce "cascading protection" -- implicit protection on pages transcluded
  into a page protected with this option enabled

  out in action=raw, so extensions might influence the output.

  to performance considerations, so it just shows "full protected" or
  "semi protected".
* (bug 4133) Allow page protections to be made with an expiry date, in the same format

  made with the new field left blank.

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.10 requires PHP 5 (5.1 recommended). PHP 4 is no longer supported.

PHP 5.0.x fails on 64-bit systems due to serious bugs with array processing:
http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=34879
Upgrade affected systems to PHP 5.1 or higher.

MySQL 3.23.x is no longer supported; some older hosts may need to upgrade.
At this time we still recommend 4.0, but 4.1/5.0 will work fine in most cases.


== Upgrading ==

Some minor database changes have been made since 1.7:
* new fields and indexes on ipblocks
* index change on recentchanges

Several changes from 1.5 and 1.6 do require updates to be run on upgrade.
To ensure that these tables are filled with data, run refreshLinks.php after
the upgrade.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, some major database
changes are made, and there is a slightly higher chance that things could
break. Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.



=== Caveats ===

Some output, particularly involving user-supplied inline HTML, may not
produce 100% valid or well-formed XHTML output. Testers are welcome to
set $wgMimeType = "application/xhtml+xml"; to test for remaining problem
cases, but this is not recommended on live sites. (This must be set for
MathML to display properly in Mozilla.)
