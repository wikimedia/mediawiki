= MediaWiki release notes =

Security reminder: MediaWiki does not require PHP's register_globals
setting since version 1.2.0. If you have it on, turn it *off* if you can.

== MediaWiki 1.10 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET.

MediaWiki is now using a "continuous integration" development model with
quarterly snapshot releases. The latest development code is always kept
"ready to run", and in fact runs our own sites on Wikipedia.

Release branches will continue to receive security updates for about a year
from first release, but nonessential bugfixes and feature development happen
will be made on the development trunk and appear in the next quarterly release.

Those wishing to use the latest code instead of a branch release can obtain
it from source control: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Download_from_SVN

== Configuration changes ==

== Major new features ==

== Changes since 1.9 ==

* (bug 7292) Fix site statistics when moving pages in/out of content namespaces
* (bug 6937) Introduce "statistics-footer" message, appended to Special:Statistics
* (bug 8531) Correct local name of LingÃ¡la (patch by Raymond)
* (bug 6638) List block flags in block log entries
* New script maintenance/language/checkExtensioni18n.php used to check i18n
  progress in the extension repository.
* Running maintenance/parserTests.php with '--record' option, will now automaticly
  tries to create its database tables.
* Made the PLURAL: parser function return singular on -1 per default.
* Fixed up the AjaxSearch
* (bugs 5051, 5376) Tooltips and accesskeys no longer require JavaScript
* Added SkinTemplateOutputPageBeforeExec hook before SkinTemplate::outputPage()
  starts page output (http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-l/2007-January/028554.html)
* Fix SpecialVersion->formatCredits input. Version and Url parameters should be null
  to be treated properly with isset.
* Branch page_restrictions column out into its own table, also creating a "cascading protection"
   feature, which automagically disallows edits to pages transcluded into a page protected with
   this new option. Various other code tidiness fixes and refactoring in the log messages of
   branches/werdna/restrictions-separation.
* The minimum permissions needed to edit a page in each namespace can
  now be customized via the $wgNamespaceProtection array.  By default,
  editing pages in the MediaWiki namespace requires "editinterface"
  permissions, just as before.
* (bug 8567) Added hook RawPageViewBeforeOutput just before the text is blown out in action=raw,
             so extensions might influence the output.
* Correct tooltip accesskey hint for Opera on the Macintosh (it uses Shift-Esc-, not Ctrl-).
* (bug 3446) Add user preference to hide page content below diffs, can be overridden by adding
             diffonly=1 or diffonly=0 to the URL of the diff page
* (bug 8002) Math should render left-to-right even in right-to-left wikis
* Pass e-mail and real name fields to AuthPlugin::addUser, as additional
  optional fields, which may be considered useful at registration time.
* Fixed Postgres upgrade script.
* (bug 8613) Fix error when viewing "Recent Changes" and using Postgres.
* Initialise site_stats table at upgrade time if data was missing
* (bug 7250) Updated Unicode normalization tables to Unicode 5.0
* Add 'purge' privilege to replace the hardcoded check for login state in
  determining whether action=purge can be done via GET. Switching the
  permission on for anons can be helpful for benchmarking.
* Unmaintained Oracle support files have been removed.
* Made Linker::userToolLinks() show the contribs link red when the user has zero edits
* Use browser default for printing size, don't force to 11pt
* (bug 8632) Fix regression in page protection null edit update
* (bug 7842) Link back to deleted revision list from deleted revision preview
* (bug 8619) Add user-aware "unblock" link to Special:Blockip
* (bug 8407) Disallow indexing of "printable" versions
* (bug 8522) Provide a "delete" link on Special:Brokenredirects for users with
  the appropriate permission
* (bug 8628) Add user-aware block list link to Special:Blockip
* (bug 8643) Correctly escape the page-specific CSS class for non-Monobook skins
* (bug 8629) Document $wgFilterCallback
* (bug 1000) Clarify warning about memory_limit in installer
* Suppress PHP warning about set_time_limit in installer when safe mode is on
* (bug 3000) Fall back to SCRIPT_NAME plus QUERY_STRING when REQUEST_URI is
  not available, as on IIS with PHP-CGI
* (bug 8621) Log revisions marked as patrolled
* Introduce "BookInformation" hook; see docs/hooks.txt for more details

== Languages updated ==

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.10 requires PHP 5 (5.1 recommended). PHP 4 is no longer supported.

PHP 5.0.x fails on 64-bit systems due to serious bugs with array processing:
http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=34879
Upgrade affected systems to PHP 5.1 or higher.

MySQL 3.23.x is no longer supported; some older hosts may need to upgrade.
At this time we still recommend 4.0, but 4.1/5.0 will work fine in most cases.


== Upgrading ==

Some minor database changes have been made since 1.7:
* new fields and indexes on ipblocks
* index change on recentchanges

Several changes from 1.5 and 1.6 do require updates to be run on upgrade.
To ensure that these tables are filled with data, run refreshLinks.php after
the upgrade.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, some major database
changes are made, and there is a slightly higher chance that things could
break. Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.



=== Caveats ===

Some output, particularly involving user-supplied inline HTML, may not
produce 100% valid or well-formed XHTML output. Testers are welcome to
set $wgMimeType = "application/xhtml+xml"; to test for remaining problem
cases, but this is not recommended on live sites. (This must be set for
MathML to display properly in Mozilla.)

=== Online documentation ===

Documentation for both end-users and site administrators is currently being
built up on Meta-Wikipedia, and is covered under the GNU Free Documentation

=== Mailing list ===

A MediaWiki-l mailing list has been set up distinct from the Wikipedia
wikitech-l list:

  http://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-l

A low-traffic announcements-only list is also available:

  http://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-announce

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.


=== IRC help ===

There's usually someone online in #mediawiki on irc.freenode.net
