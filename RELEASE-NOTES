Security reminder: MediaWiki does not require PHP's register_globals
setting since version 1.2.0. If you have it on, turn it *off* if you can.

== MediaWiki 1.6.10 ==

February 20, 2007

This is a security and bug-fix update to the Spring 2006 quarterly release.

An XSS injection vulnerability based on Microsoft Internet Explorer's UTF-7
charset autodetection was located in the AJAX support module, affecting MSIE
users on MediaWiki 1.6.x and up when the optional setting $wgUseAjax is
enabled.

If you are using an extension based on the optional Ajax module,
either disable it or upgrade to a version containing the fix:

* 1.9: fixed in 1.9.3
* 1.8: fixed in 1.8.4
* 1.7: fixed in 1.7.3
* 1.6: fixed in 1.6.10

There is no known danger in the default configuration, with $wgUseAjax off.

* (bug 8819) Fix full path disclosure with skins dependencies
* Add 'charset' to Content-Type headers on various HTTP error responses
  to forestall additional UTF-7-autodetect XSS issues. PHP sends only
  'text/html' by default when the script didn't specify more details,
  which some inconsiderate browsers consider a license to autodetect
  the deadly, hard-to-escape UTF-7.
    This fixes an issue with the Ajax interface error message on MSIE when
  $wgUseAjax is enabled (not default configuration); this UTF-7 variant
  on a previously fixed attack vector was discovered by Moshe BA from BugSec:
  http://www.bugsec.com/articles.php?Security=24
* Trackback responses now specify XML content type


== MediaWiki 1.6.9 ==

January 9, 2007

* (bug 6621) Backported German translation for 'eauthentsent'
* (bug 6680) Added localisation for Dutch bookstore list (nl)
* (bug 6730) Clearer usage of message 'titlematch' in German translation (de)
* XSS fix in AJAX module

An XSS injection vulnerability was located in the AJAX support module,
affecting MediaWiki 1.6.x and up when the optional setting $wgUseAjax
is enabled.

There is no danger in the default configuration, with $wgUseAjax off.

If you are using an extension based on the optional AJAX module,
either disable it or upgrade to a version containing the fix:

* 1.9: fixed in 1.9.0rc2
* 1.8: fixed in 1.8.3
* 1.7: fixed in 1.7.2
* 1.6: fixed in 1.6.9


== MediaWiki 1.6.8 ==

July 8, 2006

MediaWiki 1.6.8 is a security and bugfix maintenance release of the
Spring 2006 snapshot:

A potential HTML/JavaScript-injection vulnerability in a debugging script
has been fixed. Only versions and configurations of PHP vulnerable to the
$GLOBALS overwrite vulnerability are affected.

As a workaround for existing installs, profileinfo.php may simply be deleted
if it's not being used.

* (bug 5957) Updates to Hebrew translation (he)
* Respect language directionality when displaying arrow in Special:Brokenredirects
* (bug 6415) Typo in Parser.php
* Fixed potential XSS in profileinfo.php


== MediaWiki 1.6.7 ==

June 6, 2006

MediaWiki 1.6.7 is a security and bugfix maintenance release of the
Spring 2006 snapshot:

An HTML/JavaScript-injection vulnerability in the edit form has been closed.
This vulnerability was new in 1.6.0; MediaWiki versions 1.5.x or earlier are
not affected.

Extensions, comments, and <nowiki> sections are now handled in a one-pass
way which is more reliable and safer. Under earlier versions of MediaWiki,
certain extensions could be abused to inject HTML/JavaScript into the page.

Additional precautions are made against offsite form submissions when
the restricted raw HTML mode is enabled.

Some small localization and user interface updates are also included.

* (bug 6051) Improvement to German localisation (de)
* (bug 6017) Update bookstore list for German language (de)
* (bug 6138) Minor grammar tweak in "loginreqlink"
* (bug 5957) Update for Hebrew language (he)
* Increase robustness of parser placeholders; fixes some glitches when
  adjacent to identifier-ish constructs such as URLs.
* (bug 5384) Fix <!-- comments --> in <ref> extension
* Nesting of different tag extensions and comments should now work more
  consistently and more safely. A cleaner, one-pass tag strip lets the
  'outer' tag either take source (<nowiki>-style) or pass it down to
  further parsing (<ref>-style). There should no longer be surprise
  expansion of foreign extensions inside HTML output, or differences
  in behavior based on the order tags are loaded.
* (bug 885) Pre-save transform no longer silently appends close tags
* Pre-save transform no longer changes the case of close tags
* Edit security precautions in raw HTML mode, etc


== MediaWiki 1.6.6 ==

May 23, 2006

MediaWiki 1.6.6 is a security and bugfix maintenance release.

An XSS injection vector in brace replacement has been fixed, as have some
potential problems with table parsing. Upgrading is strongly recommended
for all users of 1.6. MediaWiki versions 1.5 and earlier are not affected.

Additionally some localization and user interface updates are included.

* Correct "revertpage" message in English
* (bug 5507) Logouttext uses now wiki markup
* (bug 5857, 5957) Update for German localisation (de)
* (bug 5586) <gallery> treated text as links
* (bug 5957) Update for Hebrew language (he)
* (bug 6025) SpecialImport: wrong message when no file selected
* (bug 6015) EditPage: add spacing in the boxes "edit is minor" and "watch this"
* (bug 6018) Userrights: new message when no user specified ('nouserspecified')
* (bug 6055) Fix for HTML/JS injection bug in variable handler (found by Nick Jenkins)
* Reordered wiki table handling and __TOC__ extraction in the parser to better
  handle some overlapping tag cases.
* Only the first __TOC__ is now turned into a TOC.
* (bug 361) URL in URL, they were almost fixed. Now they are.

== MediaWiki 1.6.0 ==

April 5, 2006

MediaWiki is now using a "continuous integration" development model with
quarterly snapshot releases. The latest development code is always kept
"ready to run", and in fact runs our own sites on Wikipedia.

Release branches will continue to receive security updates for about a year
from first release, but nonessential bugfixes and feature development happen
will be made on the development trunk and appear in the next quarterly release.

Those wishing to use the latest code instead of a branch release can obtain
it from source control: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Download_from_SVN


=== What's new in 1.6 ===

User interface:
* The account creation form has been separated from the user login form.
* Page protection/unprotection uses a new, expanded form

Templates:
* Categories and "what links here" now update as expected when adding or
  removing links in a template.
* Template parameters can now have default values, as {{{name|default value}}}

Uploads:
* Optional support for rasterizing SVG images to PNG for inline dislay

Feeds:
* Feed generation upgraded to Atom 1.0
* Diffs in RSS and Atom feeds are now colored for improved readability.

Database:
* MySQL 3.23.x support dropped; 4.0 or later required
* Experimental support for Unicode mode of MySQL 4.1/5.0 (moderately tested)
* Experimental Oracle support (not well tested!)

Anti-spam extension support:
* Spam blacklist extension now has support for automated cleanup:
  http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/SpamBlacklist_extension
* Support for a captcha extension to restrict automated spam edits:
  http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/ConfirmEdit_extension

Numerous bug fixes and other behind-the-scenes changes have been made;
see the file HISTORY for a complete change list.


== Compatibility ==

Older PHP 4.2 and 4.1 releases are no longer supported; PHP 4 users must
upgrade to 4.3.3 or later.

MediaWiki 1.6 is the last major version to support PHP 4; future versions
will require PHP 5.

MySQL 3.23.x is no longer supported; some older hosts may need to upgrade.
At this time we still recommend 4.0, but 4.1/5.0 will work fine in most cases.


== Upgrading ==

Several changes to the database have been made from 1.5; these are relatively
minor but do require that the update process be run before the new code will
work properly:

* A new "templatelinks" table tracks template inclusions.
* A new "externallinks" table tracks URL links; this can be used by a
  mass spam-cleanup tool in the SpamBlacklist extension.
* A new "jobs" table stores a queue of pages to update in the background; this
  is used to update links in including pages when templates are edited.

To ensure that these tables are filled with data, run refreshLinks.php after
the upgrade.

The format of the $wgUrlProtocols has changed from 1.5; it is now an array
instead of a regular expression string. If you have customized this setting
you will need to change it or external links will not work properly. See
includes/DefaultSettings.php for the updated format.


If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, some major database
changes are made, and there is a slightly higher chance that things could
break. Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.



=== Caveats ===

Some output, particularly involving user-supplied inline HTML, may not
produce 100% valid or well-formed XHTML output. Testers are welcome to
set $wgMimeType = "application/xhtml+xml"; to test for remaining problem
cases, but this is not recommended on live sites. (This must be set for
MathML to display properly in Mozilla.)


For notes on 1.5.x and older releases, see HISTORY.


=== Online documentation ===

Documentation for both end-users and site administrators is currently being
built up on Meta-Wikipedia, and is covered under the GNU Free Documentation
License:

=== Mailing list ===

A MediaWiki-l mailing list has been set up distinct from the Wikipedia
wikitech-l list:

  http://mail.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-l

A low-traffic announcements-only list is also available:

  http://mail.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-announce

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.
