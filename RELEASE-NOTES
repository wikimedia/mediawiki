= MediaWiki release notes =

Security reminder: MediaWiki does not require PHP's register_globals
setting since version 1.2.0. If you have it on, turn it *off* if you can.

== MediaWiki 1.17 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki is now using a "continuous integration" development model with
quarterly snapshot releases. The latest development code is always kept
"ready to run", and in fact runs our own sites on Wikipedia.

Release branches will continue to receive security updates for about a year
from first release, but nonessential bugfixes and feature developments
will be made on the development trunk and appear in the next quarterly release.

Those wishing to use the latest code instead of a branch release can obtain
it from source control: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Download_from_SVN

=== New installer in 1.17 ===
MediaWiki 1.17 is shipping with a completely redesigned installer to fix
a lot of outstanding bugs, cleanup the code quality, and make it easier to
use. Notably, you can now run upgrades from the web without having to move
LocalSettings.php. The specific bugs are listed below in the general notes.

=== Configuration changes in 1.17 ===
* DatabaseFunctions.php that was needed for compatibility with pre-1.3
  extensions has been removed.
* $wgLogAutocreatedAccounts controls whether autocreation of accounts is logged
  to new users log.
* $wgAllowImageTag can be set to true to whitelist the <img> tag in wikitext.
* (bug 12797) Add $wgGalleryOptions for adjusting of default gallery display
  options.
* $wgAllowUserCssPrefs option allows disabling CSS-based preferences; which can
  improve page loading speed.
* (bug 22858) $wgLocalStylePath is by default set to the same value as
  $wgStylePath but should never point to a different domain than the site is
  on, allowing skins to use .htc files which are not cross-domain friendly.
* (bug 20193) Added $wgVectorShowVariantName global configuration variable
  which causes Vector to render the variants drop-down menu with a label
  showing the current variant name. This is off by default, pending further
  research into its user experience implications.
* Added $wgJQueryVersion, $wgJQueryMinified and $wgJQueryOnEveryPage (true by
  default) to configure loading of jQuery by MediaWiki.
* XmlFunctions.php has been removed. Use the Xml or Html classes as appropriate.
* Added $wgSQLMode for setting database SQL modes - either performance (null)
  or other reasons (such as enabling stricter checks)
* $wgFileStore has been deprecated. The only usage $wgFileStore['deleted'] has
  been turned into $wgDeletedDirectory.
* $wgDeletedDirectory has been added to specify what directory to place deleted
  uploads in.
* IBM DB2 database no longer uses the db specific $wgDBport_db2 variable but the
  normal $wgDBport.
* The upload link for missing files can now be set separately from the
  navigation link with $wgUploadMissingFileUrl.
* $wgCategoryPrefixedDefaultSortkey was removed and is now always false.  This
  provides more sensible sorting behavior for categories.
* Removed unused globals: $wgEnableSerializedMessages, $wgCheckSerialized,
  $wgUseMemCached, $wgDisableSearchContext, $wgColorErrors,
  $wgUseZhdaemon, $wgZhdaemonHost and $wgZhdaemonPort.
* (bug 24408) The include_path is not modified in the default LocalSettings.php
* $wgVectorExtraStyles was removed, and is no longer in use.
* $wgLoadScript was added to specify alternative locations for ResourceLoader
  requests.
* $wgResourceLoaderMaxage was added to specify maxage and smaxage times for
  responses from ResourceLoader based on whether the request's URL contained a
  version parameter or not.
* $wgResourceLoaderDebug was added to specify the default state of debug mode;
  this will still be overridden with the debug URL parameter a la
  $wgLanguageCode.
* $wgResourceLoaderInlinePrivateModules was added to specify whether private
  modules such as user.options should be embedded in the HTML output or
  delivered through a resource loader request, which bypasses server cache (like
  squid) and checks the user parameter against $wgUser. The former adds more
  data to all pages, while the latter adds a request which cannot be cached
  server side.
* Removed $wgUpdates for database updates; extension should use
  DatabaseUpdater::addExtensionUpdate().
* Removed $wgServerName. It doesn't need to be set anymore and is no longer 
  available as input for other configuration items, either.
* Remove $wgRemoteUploads. It was not well supported and superseded by
  $wgUploadNavigationUrl.
* (bug 198) $wgUpgradeKey allows unlocking the web installer for upgrades
  without having to move LocalSettings.php
* The FailFunction "error handling" method has now been removed
* $wgAdditionalMailParams added to allow setting extra options to mail() calls.
* $wgSecureLogin & $wgSecureLoginStickHTTPS to optionaly login using HTTPS
* (bug 25728) Added $wgPasswordSenderName to allow customise the name associed
  with $wgPasswordSender

  NOW, not to the timestamp of the last edit

  reduce confusion

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.17 requires PHP 5.1 (5.2 recommended). PHP 4 is no longer
supported.

MySQL 3.23.x is no longer supported; some older hosts may need to upgrade.
At this time we still recommend 4.0, but 4.1/5.0 will work fine in most cases.


== Upgrading ==

1.17 has several database changes since 1.16, and will not work without schema
updates.

If upgrading from before 1.11, and you are using a wiki as a commons reposito-
ry, make sure that it is updated as well. Otherwise, errors may arise due to
database schema changes.

If upgrading from before 1.7, you may want to run refreshLinks.php to ensure
new database fields are filled with data.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, some major database
changes are made, and there is a slightly higher chance that things could
break. Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.


=== Caveats ===

Some output, particularly involving user-supplied inline HTML, may not
produce 100% valid or well-formed XHTML output. Testers are welcome to
set $wgMimeType = "application/xhtml+xml"; to test for remaining problem
cases, but this is not recommended on live sites. (This must be set for
MathML to display properly in Mozilla.)

For notes on 1.16.x and older releases, see HISTORY.


=== Online documentation ===

Documentation for both end-users and site administrators is currently being
built up on MediaWiki.org, and is covered under the GNU Free Documentation
License (except for pages that explicitly state that their contents are in
the public domain) :

  http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Documentation


=== Mailing list ===

A MediaWiki-l mailing list has been set up distinct from the Wikipedia
wikitech-l list:

  http://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-l

A low-traffic announcements-only list is also available:

  http://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-announce

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.


=== IRC help ===

There's usually someone online in #mediawiki on irc.freenode.net
