Security reminder: MediaWiki does not require PHP's register_globals
setting since version 1.2.0. If you have it on, turn it *off* if you can.


== MediaWiki 1.5 beta 1 ==

June 26, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5 beta 1 is a preview release, pretty much feature complete,
of the new 1.5 release series. There are several known and likely a number
of unknown bugs; it is not recommended to use this release in a production
environment but would be recommended for testing in mind of an upcoming
deployment.

A number of significant changes have been made since the alpha releases,
including database changes and a reworking of the user permissions settings.
See the file UPGRADE for details of upgrading and changing your prior
configuration settings for the new system.



== MediaWiki 1.5 alpha 2 ==

June 3, 2005

MediaWiki 1.5 alpha 2 includes a lot of bug fixes, feature merges,
and a security update.

Incorrect handling of page template inclusions made it possible to
inject JavaScript code into HTML attributes, which could lead to
cross-site scripting attacks on a publicly editable wiki.

Vulnerable releases and fix:
* 1.5 prerelease: fixed in 1.5alpha2
* 1.4 stable series: fixed in 1.4.5
* 1.3 legacy series: fixed in 1.3.13
* 1.2 series no longer supported; upgrade to 1.4.5 strongly recommended


== MediaWiki 1.5 alpha 1 ==

May 3, 2005

This is a testing preview release, being put out mainly to aid testers in
finding installation bugs and other major problems. It is strongly recommended
NOT to run a live production web site on this alpha release.

**  WARNING: USE OF THIS ALPHA RELEASE MAY INFEST YOUR HOUSE WITH  **
**  TERMITES, ROT YOUR TEETH,  GROW HAIR ON YOUR PALMS, AND PASTE  **
**  INNUENDO  INTO  YOUR  C.V.  RIGHT  BEFORE  A  JOB  INTERVIEW!  **
**  DON'T SAY WE DIDN'T WARN YOU, MAN. WE TOTALLY DID RIGHT HERE.  **


=== Big changes ===

Schema:
  The core table schema has changed significantly. This should make better
  use of the database's cache and disk I/O, and make significantly speed up
  rename and delete operations on pages with very long edit histories.
  
  Unfortunately this does mean upgrading a wiki of size from 1.4 will require
  some downtime for the schema restructuring, but future storage backend
  changes should be able to integrate into the new system more easily.

Permalinks:
  The current revision of a page now has a permanent 'oldid' number assigned
  immediately, and the id numbers are now preserved across deletion/undeletion.
  A permanent reference to the current revision of a page is now just a matter
  of going to the 'history' tab and copying the first link in the list.

Page move log:
  Renames of pages are now recorded in Special:Log and the page history.
  A handy revert link is available from the log for sysops.

Editing diff:
  Ever lost track of what you'd done so far during an edit? A 'Show diff'
  button on the edit page now makes it easy to remember.

Uploads:
  It's now possible to specify the final filename of an upload distinct
  from the original filename on your disk.
  
  An image link for a missing file will now take you straight to the upload page.
  
  More metadata is pre-extracted from uploaded images, which will ease pressure
  on disk or NFS volumes used to store images. EXIF metadata is displayed on
  the image description page if PHP is configured with the necessary module.

User accounts:
  There are some changes to the user permissions system, with assignable
  groups. This is still somewhat in flux; do not rely on the present system
  that you see in this alpha to still be there.

E-mail:
  User-to-user e-mail can now be restricted to require a mail-back confirmation
  first to reduce potential for abuse with false addresses.
  
  Updates to user talk pages and watchlist entries can optionally send e-mail
  notifications.

External hooks:
  A somewhat experimental interface for hooking in an external editor
  application is included. This may not be on by default in final release,
  depending on support.

And...
  A bunch of stuff we forgot to mention.


=== What's gone? ===

Latin-1:
  Wikis must now be encoded in Unicode UTF-8; this has been the default for
  some time, but some languages could optionally be installed in Latin-1 mode.
  This is no longer supported.

MySQL 3.x:
  Some optimization hacks for MySQL 3.x have been removed as part of the schema
  clean-up (specifically, the inverse_timestamp fields). MediaWiki 1.5 should
  still run, but wikis of significant size should very seriously consider
  upgrading to a more modern release. MySQL 3.x support will probably be
  entirely dropped in the next major release later this year.

Special:Maintenance
  These tools were, ironically enough, not really maintained. This special
  page has been removed; insofar as some of its pieces were useful and haven't
  already been supplanted by other special pages they should be rewritten in
  an efficient and safe manner in the future.


=== What's still waiting? ===

These things should be fixed by the time 1.5.0 final is released:

Upgrade:
  Wikis in Latin-1 encoding are no longer supported; only Unicode UTF-8.
  A new option $wgLegacyEncoding is provided to allow on-the-fly recoding of
  old page text entries, but other metadata fields (titles, comments etc) need
  to be pre-converted. The upgrade process does not yet fully automate this.
  
  In general the upgrade from 1.4 to 1.5 schema has not been tested for all
  cases, and there may be problems.

Backups:
  The text entries of deleted pages are no longer removed from the main
  text table on deletion. If you provide public backup dumps of your databases,
  you will probably want to use the new XML-format dump generator... but
  this hasn't been finished yet.

PostgreSQL:
  The table definitions for PostgreSQL install are out of date, and patches
  to support PostgreSQL from the main installer are still pending.

MySQL 4.1+:
  Proper charset encoding / collation configuration for installs on MySQL 4.1
  and higher still needs to be fiddled with. Some bits may fail on the UTF-8
  setting due to some long field keys.

Authentication plugin fixes:
  The AuthPlugin interface needs some improvements to work better with LDAP,
  HTTP basic auth, and other such environments. Some patches are pending.


=== Smaller changes ===

* 'live preview' reduces preview reload burden on supported browsers

=== Caveats ===

Some output, particularly involving user-supplied inline HTML, may not
produce 100% valid or well-formed XHTML output. Testers are welcome to
set $wgMimeType = "application/xhtml+xml"; to test for remaining problem
cases, but this is not recommended on live sites. (This must be set for
MathML to display properly in Mozilla.)
