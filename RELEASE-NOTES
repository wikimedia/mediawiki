= MediaWiki release notes =

Security reminder: MediaWiki does not require PHP's register_globals
setting since version 1.2.0. If you have it on, turn it *off* if you can.

== MediaWiki 1.9 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET.

MediaWiki is now using a "continuous integration" development model with
quarterly snapshot releases. The latest development code is always kept
"ready to run", and in fact runs our own sites on Wikipedia.

Release branches will continue to receive security updates for about a year
from first release, but nonessential bugfixes and feature development happen
will be made on the development trunk and appear in the next quarterly release.

Those wishing to use the latest code instead of a branch release can obtain
it from source control: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Download_from_SVN

* (bug 5149) When autoblocks are enabled, retroactively apply an autoblock to the most
  recently used IP of a user when they are blocked.

  into the HTML output.
* Make the DNSBL to check for proxy blocking configurable via $wgSorbsUrl
* Add experimental recording/reporting mode to parser tests runner, to
  compare changes against the previous run.
  Additional tables 'testrun' and 'testitem' are in maintenance/testRunner.sql,
  source this and pass --record option to parserTests.php
* Make the set of default parser test input files extensible via
  $wgParserTestFiles. This can now be appended to by extensions or local
  configuration files so that extension or custom tests can be automatically
  run along with the main batch.
* Run PHP install version checks on update.php so command-line updaters see
  new version requirements
* Do a check for the PHP 5.0.x 64-bit bug, since this is much more disruptive
  as of MW 1.8 than it used to be. Install or upgrade now aborts with a
  warning and a request to upgrade.
* (bug 6440) Updated indexes to improve backlinking queries (links, templates, images)
* Switched 'anon-only' block mode to default for IP blocks
* (bug 3687, 7892) Add distinct heading for media files in category display,

  PHP config var cgi.fix_pathinfo isn't detectable through ini_get(), but
  we can find some side-effects. Only tested on lighttpd so far, hopefully
  right on Apache too!
* Replace 'old-revision-navigation' message with 'revision-info' and
  'revision-nav' messages, wrapped in divs with appropriate id's.
* (bug 4178) MediaWiki:Common.js will now be included for all users if
  $wgUseSiteJs is enabled, in addition to (if applicable) MediaWiki:Monobook.js
  and user JS subpages.
* (bug 7918) "Templates used on this page" changes during preview to reflect
  any added or removed templates, and works as expected for section edits.

* (bug 7688) When viewing diff, section anchors in autosummary jump to section
  on current page instead of loading the latest version.
* (bug 7970) Use current connection explicitly on Database::getServerVersion
* (bug 2001) Tables with class="sortable" can now be dynamically sorted via
  JavaScript.
* Added autosummary for new pages with 500 or less characters, and refactor
   the autosummary code so it's all done in one function. doEdit is getting too
   big!
* (bug 7554) The correct MIME type for SVG images is now displayed on the
  image page (image/svg+xml, not image/svg).
* (bug 7883) Added autoblock whitelisting feature, using which specific ranges
   can be protected from autoblocking. These ranges are specified, in list format,
   in the autoblock_whitelist system message.
* Added placeholders for text injection by hooks to EditPage.php
* (bug 8009) Automatic edit summary for redirects is not filled for edits in existing pages
* Installer support for experimental MySQL 4.1/5.0 binary-safe schema
* Use INSERT IGNORE for db-based BagOStuff add/insert, for more memcache-like
  behavior when keys already exist on add (instead of dying with an error...)
* Add a hook 'UploadForm:initial' before the upload form is generated, and two
  member variable for text injection into the form, which can be filled by the hooks.
* (bug 6295) Add a "revision patching" functionality, where an edit can be undone
  (with a functionality similar to diff rev1 rev2 | patch -R rev3 -o rev3).
  This is triggered by including &undo=revid in an edit URL. A link to a URL
  that will undo a given edit is shown on NEW NON-CURRENT revision headers on diff pages.
* Fix display of link in "already rolled back" message for image/category pages
* (bug 6016) Left-aligned images should stack vertically, like right-aligned
  images, not horizontally.
* Patch from LeonWP: added UploadForm:BeforeProcessing hook in SpecialUpload.php
* Add AuthPluginSetup hook to override $wgAuth after configuration
* Fix regression in authentication hook auto-creation on login
* (bug 8110) Allow spaces in ISBNs
* (bug 8024) Introduce "send me copies of emails I send to others" preference
* Added 'EditPage::attemptSave' hook before an article is saved.
* (bug 8083) Applied patch for sk localisation
* Add a backslash character to the edit token, to prevent edits via certain
  broken proxies that mangle such characters in form submissions
* (bug 7461) Allow overwriting pages using importTextFile.php
* (bug 7946) importTextFile.php doesn't perform pre-save transform
* (bug 8117) {{REVISIONTIMESTAMP}} showed weird default if $wgLocalTZoffset set;
  now uses current time for previews and if timestamp can't be loaded from DB
* {{REVISIONTIMESTAMP}} now uses site local timezone instead of user timezone
  to ensure consistent behavior
* {{REVISIONTIMESTAMP}} and friends should now work on non-MySQL backends
* (bug 7671) Observe canonical media namespace prefix in Linker::formatComment
* Added js variable wgCurRevisionId to the output
* (bug 8141) Cleanup of Parser::doTableStuff, patch by AzaTht
* (bug 8042) Make miser mode caching limits settable via $wgQueryCacheLimit
  instead of hardcoding to 1000
* Enable QueryPage classes to override list formatting
* (bug 5485) Show number of intervening revisions in diff view
* (bug 8100) Fix XHTML validity in Taiwanese localization
* Added redirect to section feature. Use it wisely.
* Added a configuration variable allowing the "break out of framesets" feature 
  to be switched on and off ($wgBreakFrames). Off by default.
* Allow Xml::check() $attribs parameter to override 'value' attribute
* DB schema change: added two columns (rc_old_len and rc_new_len) to the recentchanges table to store
  the text lengths before and after the edit
* (bug 1085) Made Special:Recentchanges show the character difference between the changed revisions
* Removed a redundant <strong> tag from diff pages that was causing display issues for some users
* (bug 8203) The keyboard shortcut for "log out" was removed, because users were pressing it
  when they intended to press the shortcut for "preview".
* (bug 8148) Handle non-removable output buffers gracefully when cleaning
  buffers for HTTP 304 responses, StreamFile, and Special:Export.
  Duplicated code merged into wfResetOutputBuffers() and wfClearOutputBuffers()
* Special:AllPages : 'next page' link now point to the first title of the next
  chunk instead of pointing to the last title of current chunk.
* (bug 4673) Special:AllPages : add a 'previous' link (new message 'prevpage')
* (bug 8121) wfRandom() was not between 0 and 1
* Add static method Parser::createAssocArgs($args), so parser functions can
  use the same code to parse arguments as the templates do.
* Change behavior of logins using the temporary e-mailed password (as stored
  in user_newpassword hash field). Instead of just logging in silently and
  leaving the previous user_password field in place indefinitely, the user
  is now prompted to set a new password.
  
  The password-changing form is at Special:Resetpass; currently it's only
  usable for changing from the temporary password during login, but it
  could perhaps be generalized, replacing the subform in preferences.
  
  Once the new password is set successfully, the temporary password is wiped
  so it cannot be used to login a second time, and the login process
  is completed.
* Suppress 'mail new password' button on login form if $wgAuth forbids
  changing user passwords; it wouldn't work very well...
* Consolidate password length checks and $wgAuth manipulation into
  User::setPassword() to avoid duplicate code in different places
  that set passwords.
* User::setPassword() now throws PasswordError exceptions if the password
  is illegal or cannot be set via $wgAuth. These can be caught and a human-
  readable error message displayed by UI code.
* Added Title::isSubpage()
* (bug 8241) Don't consider user pages of User:Foo.css to be CSS subpages
* Set an explicit class on framed thumbnail inner divs and images, changed some 
  CSS to use these instead of using descendent selectors.
* Accept null parameter to User::setPassword() as indicating the password
  field should be cleared to an unusable state. Login will only be possible
  after the password is reset, for instance by e-mail.
* (bug 6394) Invalidate the password set for "by e-mail" account creations
  to avoid accidental empty password creations.
* Made the show change size function work on page moves, page creations, and 
  log entries. Also fixed it in the javascript recentchanges.
* (bug 8239) correctly get 50 new contributions when clicking '(50 next)'
* (bug 2259) Fix old regression where e-mail addresses were no longer
  confirmed on login with mailed password.
* Add a notification about the confirmation mail sent during account
  creation, so people don't immediately go off to request a second one.
* Add a warning on Special:Confirmemail if a code was already sent and has
  not yet expired.
* Add user_editcount field to provide data for heuristics on account use.
  Incremented on edit, with lazy initialization from past revision data.
  Can batch-initialize with maintenance/initEditCount.php (not yet friendly
  to replication environments, this will do all accounts in one query).
* Allow raw SQL subsections in Database::update() SET portion as well as
  for WHERE portion. Handy for increments and such.
* User::getOption now accept a default value to override default user values
  this makes it consistent with WebRequest::get* methods. Corrected code in
  various places accordingly.
* (bug 8264) Fix JavaScript global vars for XHTML mode
* Make $wgSiteNotice value wikitext again, for consistency with editable
  MediaWiki:Sitenotice and MediaWiki:Anonnotice.
* (bug 8044) When redirecting from the canonical name of the special page
  to the localised one, parameters/subpages are omitted
* (bug 8164) Special:Booksources should use GET for form submission
* Rewrite Special:Booksources to clean up interface and remove redundant code
* (bug 7925) Change Special:Allmessages message name filter javascript to be
  a bit more responsive and easier on the CPU
* (bug 4488) Support watching pages on deletion; introduces new user preference
* Minor restructuring of Special:Preferences; "watch pages I edit" and "watch
  pages I create" options now accessible under "Watchlist" options
* (bug 8153) <nowiki> doesn't work in site notice
* (bug 6690) wfMsgNoTrans() transforms messages
* (bug 8274) Wrap edit tools in a <div> with a specified class
* Detect PHP 5.0.x 64-bit bug and abort in WebStart.php; too many things break
  mysteriously otherwise (detection code copied from install-utils.inc)
* (bug 8295) Change handling of <center> tags in doBlockLevels() to match that
  of <div>
* (bug 8110) Make magic ISBN linking stricter: only match ten-digit sequences
  (plus optional ISBN-13 prefix) with no immediately following alphanumeric
  character, disallow multiple consecutive internal redirects
* (bug 2785) Accept optional colon prefix in links when formatting comments
* Don't show "you can view and copy the source of this page" message for
  pages which don't exist
* (bug 8310) Blank line added to top of 'post' when page is blank
* (bug 8109) Template parameters ignored in "recentchangestext"
* Gracefully skip redirect-to-fragment on WebKit versions less than 420;
  it messes up on current versions of Safari but is ok in the latest
  nightlies. Checking the version number will allow it to automatically
  work when new releases of Safari appear.
* Fix regression in thumb styles; size and padding didn't match with
  new arrangement.
* (bug 8326) Fix regression in thumb styles of cached content
* (bug 8333) Fix quick user data update on login password change on
  replication database setups. User data is now pulled from master
  instead of slave in User::loadFromDatabase, ensuring that it is
  fresh and accurate when read and then saved back into cache.
  This was breaking with the Special:Rename operation which
  automatically logs the user in with the new password after changing
  it; pulling from slave meant the record was often not the updated
  one.
* (bug 8335) Set image width to the first valid parameter found.
* (bug 8350) Fix watchlist viewing bug when using Postgres.
* (bug 6603) When warning about invalid file extensions, output the bit
  of the extension we actually checked
* (bug 7669) Drop defaults on BLOB/TEXT columns for better compatibility
  with MySQL's strict mode, often enabled by the Windows installer.
  The defaults are ignored anyway when strict mode is off...
* (bug 7685) Use explicit values for ar_text and ar_flags when deleting,
  for better compatibility with MySQL's strict mode
* Update default interwiki values to reflect changed location of ursine:
* (bug 5411) Remove autopatrol preference
* Users who have the "autopatrol" permission will have their edits marked as
  patrolled automatically
* Users who do not have the "autopatrol" permission will no longer be able
  to mark their own edits as patrolled

== Compatibility ==

MediaWiki 1.9 requires PHP 5 (5.1 recommended). PHP 4 is no longer supported.

PHP 5.0.x fails on 64-bit systems due to serious bugs with array processing:
http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=34879
Upgrade affected systems to PHP 5.1 or higher.

MySQL 3.23.x is no longer supported; some older hosts may need to upgrade.
At this time we still recommend 4.0, but 4.1/5.0 will work fine in most cases.


== Upgrading ==

Some minor database changes have been made since 1.7:
* new fields and indexes on ipblocks
* index change on recentchanges

Several changes from 1.5 and 1.6 do require updates to be run on upgrade.
To ensure that these tables are filled with data, run refreshLinks.php after
the upgrade.

If you are upgrading from MediaWiki 1.4.x or earlier, some major database
changes are made, and there is a slightly higher chance that things could
break. Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions.



=== Caveats ===

Some output, particularly involving user-supplied inline HTML, may not
produce 100% valid or well-formed XHTML output. Testers are welcome to
set $wgMimeType = "application/xhtml+xml"; to test for remaining problem
cases, but this is not recommended on live sites. (This must be set for
MathML to display properly in Mozilla.)


For notes on 1.5.x and older releases, see HISTORY.
