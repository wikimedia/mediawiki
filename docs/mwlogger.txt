MWLogger implements a PSR-3 [0] compatible message logging system.

The MWLogger class is actually a thin wrapper around any PSR-3 LoggerInterface
implementation. Named MWLogger instances can be obtained from the
MWLogger::getInstance() static method. MWLogger expects a class implementing
the MWLoggerSpi interface to act as a factory for new MWLogger instances.

The MWLogger::getInstance() static method is the means by which most code
acquires an MWLogger instance. This in turn delegates creation of MWLogger
instances to a class implementing the MWLoggerSpi service provider interface.

The service provider interface allows the backend logging library to be
implemented in multiple ways. The $wgMWLoggerDefaultSpi global provides the
classname of the default MWLoggerSpi implementation to be loaded at runtime.
This can either be the name of a class implementing the MWLoggerSpi with
a zero argument constructor or a callable that will return an MWLoggerSpi
instance. Alternately the MWLogger::registerProvider method can be called
to inject an MWLoggerSpi instance into MWLogger and bypass the use of this
configuration variable.

The MWLoggerMonologSpi class implements a service provider to generate
MWLogger instances that use the Monolog [1] logging library. See the PHP docs
(or source) for MWLoggerMonologSpi for details on the configuration of this
provider. The default configuration installs a null handler that will silently
discard all logging events. The documentation provided by the class describes
a more feature rich logging configuration.
