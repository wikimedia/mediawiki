This file describes MediaWiki's concept of "site info", and the SiteInfoLookup
facility.

"Site info" refers to information about other websites, that can be used to
link to such websites, access their API, etc. MediaWiki typically has such
information about other wiki sites on the same wiki "farm", but neither is
necessary: site info can describe a site that does not use mediawiki, and
is hosted on another domain and managed by an unrelated entity.

The SiteInfoLookup service unifies and supersedes the older Interwiki and
InterwikiLookup services, as well as the SiteStore and SiteLookup services.
It also covers some of the functionality of the WikiMap class.

Conceptually, the "site info" about a website is given by a key/value map.
The map can be arbitrarily extended, but some keys have a well known meaning,
and are needed to provide certain services:

* type: the type of the site. Should be set to "mediawiki" if the site is
  running MediaWiki.
* name: the human readable name of the site, for display.
* language: an IANA language tag identifying the site's content language.
  Often used for grouping.
* family: the name of the wiki's "family" within a farm. E.g. de.wikipedia.org
  would be in the "wikipedia" family, and meta.wikimedia.org would be in the
  "meta" family. This is often used for grouping.
* db-name: the wiki's database name. Often the same as the wiki ID (see below).
* db-cluster: the wiki's database server (or cluster). Can be used for grouping,
  to list all wikis hosted on the same DB server.
* forwardable: boolean indicating whether "magic redirects" are supported to
  this site. If true, using the title "abc:Test" in a URL will trigger a
  redirect to the page "Test" on the abc wiki.
* transcludable: whether content from this site can be used on the local wiki
  via the "scary transclusion" mechanism.
* base-url: The site's base URL. script-path and article-path are appended to
  this. May be protocol relative.
* script-path: The site's script path, relative to base-url. The meaning of
  this is only well defined if the type of the site is "mediawiki". In that
  case, it is the path in which the main entry points, index.php and api.php,
  can be found. This corresponds to the $wgScriptPath setting.
* article-path: The site's article path. Should contain $1 as a placeholder
  for the article title. For mediawiki sites, this corresponds to the
  $wgArticlePath setting.
