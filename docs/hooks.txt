hooks.txt

This document describes how event hooks work in MediaWiki; how to add hooks for
an event; and how to run hooks for an event.

==Glossary==

event
     Something that happens with the wiki. For example: a user logs in. A wiki
     page is saved. A wiki page is deleted. Often there are two events
     associated with a single action: one before the code is run to make the
     event happen, and one after. Each event has a name, preferably in
     CamelCase. For example, 'UserLogin', 'ArticleSave', 'ArticleSaveComplete',
     'ArticleDelete'.

hook
     A clump of code and data that should be run when an event happens. This can
     be either a function and a chunk of data, or an object and a method.
     
hook function
     The function part of a hook.
     
==Rationale==

Hooks allow us to decouple optionally-run code from code that is run for
everyone. It allows MediaWiki hackers, third-party developers and local
administrators to define code that will be run at certain points in the mainline
code, and to modify the data run by that mainline code. Hooks can keep mainline
code simple, and make it easier to write extensions. Hooks are a principled
alternative to local patches.

Consider, for example, two options in MediaWiki. One reverses the order of a
title before displaying the article; the other converts the title to all
uppercase letters. Currently, in MediaWiki code, we would handle this as follows
(note: not real code, here):

	function showAnArticle($article) {
		global $wgReverseTitle, $wgCapitalizeTitle;

		if ($wgReverseTitle) {
			wfReverseTitle($article);
		}

		if ($wgCapitalizeTitle) {
			wfCapitalizeTitle($article);
		}

		# code to actually show the article goes here
	}

An extension writer, or a local admin, will often add custom code to the
function -- with or without a global variable. For example, someone wanting
email notification when an article is shown may add:

    function showAnArticle($article) {
        global $wgReverseTitle, $wgCapitalizeTitle, $wgNotifyArticle;
	
		if ($wgReverseTitle) {
			wfReverseTitle($article);
		}
	
		if ($wgCapitalizeTitle) {
			wfCapitalizeTitle($article);
		}

		# code to actually show the article goes here
	
		if ($wgNotifyArticle) {
			wfNotifyArticleShow($article));
		}
    }

Using a hook-running strategy, we can avoid having all this option-specific
stuff in our mainline code. Using hooks, the function becomes:

	function showAnArticle($article) {

		if (wfRunHooks('ArticleShow', array(&$article))) {

			# code to actually show the article goes here

			wfRunHooks('ArticleShowComplete', array(&$article));
		}
	}

We've cleaned up the code here by removing clumps of weird, infrequently used
code and moving them off somewhere else. It's much easier for someone working
with this code to see what's _really_ going on, and make changes or fix bugs.

In addition, we can take all the code that deals with the little-used 
title-reversing options (say) and put it in one place. Instead of having little
title-reversing if-blocks spread all over the codebase in showAnArticle,
deleteAnArticle, exportArticle, etc., we can concentrate it all in an extension
file:

	function reverseArticleTitle($article) {
		# ...
	}

	function reverseForExport($article) {
		# ...
	}

The setup function for the extension just has to add its hook functions to the
appropriate events:

	setupTitleReversingExtension() {
		global $wgHooks;

		$wgHooks['ArticleShow'][] = 'reverseArticleTitle';
		$wgHooks['ArticleDelete'][] = 'reverseArticleTitle';
		$wgHooks['ArticleExport'][] = 'reverseForExport';
	}

Having all this code related to the title-reversion option in one place means
that it's easier to read and understand; you don't have to do a grep-find to see
where the $wgReverseTitle variable is used, say.

If the code is well enough isolated, it can even be excluded when not used -- 
making for some slight savings in memory and load-up performance at runtime. 
Admins who want to have all the reversed titles can add:

	require_once('extensions/ReverseTitle.php');

...to their LocalSettings.php file; those of us who don't want or need it can
just leave it out.

The extensions don't even have to be shipped with MediaWiki; they could be
provided by a third-party developer or written by the admin him/herself.

==Writing hooks==

A hook is a chunk of code run at some particular event. It consists of:

  * a function with some optional accompanying data, or
  * an object with a method and some optional accompanying data.

Hooks are registered by adding them to the global $wgHooks array for a given
event. All the following are valid ways to define hooks:

	$wgHooks['EventName'][] = 'someFunction'; # function, no data
	$wgHooks['EventName'][] = array('someFunction', $someData);
	$wgHooks['EventName'][] = array('someFunction'); # weird, but OK

	$wgHooks['EventName'][] = $object; # object only
	$wgHooks['EventName'][] = array($object, 'someMethod');
	$wgHooks['EventName'][] = array($object, 'someMethod', $someData);
	$wgHooks['EventName'][] = array($object); # weird but OK

When an event occurs, the function (or object method) will be called with the
optional data provided as well as event-specific parameters. The above examples
would result in the following code being executed when 'EventName' happened:

	# function, no data
	someFunction($param1, $param2)
	# function with data
	someFunction($someData, $param1, $param2)

	# object only
	$object->onEventName($param1, $param2)
	# object with method
	$object->someMethod($param1, $param2)
	# object with method and data
	$object->someMethod($someData, $param1, $param2)
      
Note that when an object is the hook, and there's no specified method, the
default method called is 'onEventName'. For different events this would be
different: 'onArticleSave', 'onUserLogin', etc.

The extra data is useful if we want to use the same function or object for
different purposes. For example:

	$wgHooks['ArticleSaveComplete'][] = array('ircNotify', 'TimStarling');
	$wgHooks['ArticleSaveComplete'][] = array('ircNotify', 'brion');

This code would result in ircNotify being run twice when an article is saved:
once for 'TimStarling', and once for 'brion'.

Hooks can return three possible values:

  * true: the hook has operated successfully
  * "some string": an error occurred; processing should stop and the error
                   should be shown to the user
  * false: the hook has successfully done the work necessary and the calling
           function should skip
	
The last result would be for cases where the hook function replaces the main
functionality. For example, if you wanted to authenticate users to a custom
system (LDAP, another PHP program, whatever), you could do:

	$wgHooks['UserLogin'][] = array('ldapLogin', $ldapServer);
  
	function ldapLogin($username, $password) {
		# log user into LDAP
		return false;
	}

Returning false makes less sense for events where the action is complete, and
will normally be ignored.

Note that none of the examples made use of create_function() as a way to
attach a function to a hook. This is known to cause problems (notably with 
Special:Version), and should be avoided when at all possible.

==Using hooks==

A calling function or method uses the wfRunHooks() function to run the hooks
related to a particular event, like so:

	class Article { 
		# ...
		function protect() {
			global $wgUser;
			if (wfRunHooks('ArticleProtect', array(&$this, &$wgUser))) {
				# protect the article
				wfRunHooks('ArticleProtectComplete', array(&$this, &$wgUser));
			}
		}
	}
						    
wfRunHooks() returns true if the calling function should continue processing
(the hooks ran OK, or there are no hooks to run), or false if it shouldn't (an
error occurred, or one of the hooks handled the action already). Checking the
return value matters more for "before" hooks than for "complete" hooks.

Note that hook parameters are passed in an array; this is a necessary
inconvenience to make it possible to pass reference values (that can be changed)
into the hook code. Also note that earlier versions of wfRunHooks took a
variable number of arguments; the array() calling protocol came about after
MediaWiki 1.4rc1.

==Events and parameters==

This is a list of known events and parameters; please add to it if you're going
to add events to the MediaWiki code.

of the javascript ajax engine. The hook is only called when ajax
is enabled ( $wgUseAjax = true; ).

before showing the edit form ( EditPage::edit() ). This is triggered
on &action=edit.
$EditPage : the EditPage object

after processing request parameters. Return false to let the request
fail, returning an error message or an <edit result="Failure"> tag
if $resultArr was filled.

it. The prototype of the callback function is func($pageid, $title)
where $pageid is the page ID of the page the token is requested for
and $title is the associated Title object. In the hook, just add
your callback to the $tokenFunctions array and return true (returning
false makes no sense)
$tokenFunctions: array(action => callback)

'APIQueryRevisionsTokens': use this hook to add custom tokens to prop=revisions.
Every token has an action, which will be used in the rvtoken parameter
and in the output (actiontoken="..."), and a callback function which

it. The prototype of the callback function is func($pageid, $title, $rev)
where $pageid is the page ID of the page associated to the revision the
token is requested for, $title the associated Title object and $rev the
associated Revision object. In the hook, just add your callback to the
$tokenFunctions array and return true (returning false makes no sense)
$tokenFunctions: array(action => callback)

'APIQueryRecentChangesTokens': use this hook to add custom tokens to list=recentchanges.
Every token has an action, which will be used in the rctoken parameter
and in the output (actiontoken="..."), and a callback function which

it. The prototype of the callback function is func($pageid, $title, $rc)
where $pageid is the page ID of the page associated to the revision the
token is requested for, $title the associated Title object and $rc the
associated RecentChange object. In the hook, just add your callback to the
