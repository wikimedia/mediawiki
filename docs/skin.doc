SKIN.DOC

This document describes the overall architecture of Wikipedia's
HTML rendering code. It is placed here rather than in comments
in the code itself to help reduce the code size.


Unfortunately there isn't any documentation, and the code's in
a bit of a mess right now during the transition from the old skin
code to the new template-based skin code in 1.3.

The following might help a bit though.

The first file called is Skin.php, it will check various settings and create
a standard class.

Before version 1.3, each skin had its own php file to generate the output. The
files are:
 * SkinCologneBlue.php
 * SkinNostalgia.php
 * SkinStandard.php
 * SkinWikimediaWiki.php
If you want to changes thoses skin you have to edit the php files
 
Since 1.3 a new special skin file is available : SkinPHPTal.php. It makes use
of the PHPTal template engine and allow to easily split code and layout of the
pages. The default 1.3 skin is MonoBook and using the SkinPHPTAL class.

To change the layout just edit the phptal template : ./templates/xhtml_slim.pt 
as well as the stylesheets in ./stylesheets/monobook/ .
