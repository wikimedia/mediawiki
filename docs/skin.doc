SKIN.DOC

This document describes the overall architecture of MediaWiki's
HTML rendering code. It is placed here rather than in comments
in the code itself to help reduce the code size.

Unfortunately there isn't any documentation, and the code's in
a bit of a mess right now during the transition from the old skin
code to the new template-based skin code in 1.3.

The following might help a bit though.

Firstly, there's Skin.php; this file will check various settings, and it 
contains a base class from which new skins can be derived.

Before version 1.3, each skin had its own PHP file (with a sub-class to Skin) 
to generate the output. The files are:
 * SkinCologneBlue.php
 * SkinNostalgia.php
 * SkinStandard.php
 * SkinWikimediaWiki.php
If you want to change those skins, you have to edit these PHP files.
 
Since 1.3 a new special skin file is available: SkinPHPTal.php. It makes use of
the PHPTal template engine and allows you to separate code and layout of the
pages. The default 1.3 skin is MonoBook and it uses the SkinPHPTAL class.

To change the layout, just edit the PHPTal template (templates/xhtml_slim.pt) 
as well as the stylesheets (stylesheets/monobook/*).
