SKIN.DOC

This document describes the overall architecture of Wikipedia's
HTML rendering code. It is placed here rather than in comments
in the code itself to help reduce the code size.


Unfortunately there isn't any documentation, and the code's in
a bit of a mess right now during the transition from the old skin
code to the new template-based skin code in 1.3.
