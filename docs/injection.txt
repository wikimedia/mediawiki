This is an overview of how MediaWiki makes use of dependency injection.

The term "dependency injection" (DI) refers to a pattern on object oriented
programming that tries to improve modularity by reducing strong coupling
between classes. In practical terms, this means that anything an object needs
to operate should be injected from the outside, the object itself should only
know narrow interfaces, no concrete implementation of the logic it relies on.

The requirement to inject everything typically results in an architecture that
based on two main types of objects: simple value objects with no business logic
(and often immutable), and essentially stateless service objects that user
other service objects to operate on the value objects.

As of the beginning of 2016 (MW version 1.27), MediaWiki is only starting to
use the DI approach. Much of the code still relies on global state or direct
instantiation, resulting in a highly cyclical dependency graph.


== Overview ==
The heart of the DI in MediaWiki is the central service locator,
MediaWikiServices, which acts as the top level factory for services in
MediaWiki. MediaWikiServices::getInstances() returns the default service
locator instance, which can be used to gain access to default instances of
various services. MediaWikiServices however also allows new services to be
defined and default services to be replaced. Services are defined or
replaced be providing a callback that will return a new instance of the
service.

When MediaWikiServices::getInstances() is first called, it will create an
instance of MediaWikiServices and populates it with the services defined
in the file ServiceWiring.php, thereby "bootstrapping" the DI framework.
The file ServiceWiring.php defines all default service implementations, and
specifies how they depend on each other ("wiring").

When a new service is added to MediaWiki core, a callback that will instantiate
an appropriate default instance for that service must be added to
ServiceWiring.php. This makes the service available through the generic
getService() method on the service locator returned by
MediaWikiServices::getInstance().

Extensions can use the 'MediaWikiServices' hook to define or replace services
by calling methods on the freshly created MediaWikiServices instance.


It should be noted that the term "service locator" is often used to refer to a
top level factory that is accessed directly, throughout the code, to avoid
explicit dependency injection. In contrast, the term "DI container" is often
used to describe a top level factory that is only accessed when services
are created. We use the term "service locator" for the top level factory
because it is more descriptive than "DI container", even though application
logic is strongly discouraged from accessing MediaWikiServices directly.
MediaWikiServices:.getInstances() should ideally be accessed only in "static
entry points" such as hook handler functions. See "DI Principles" and
"Migration" below.


== Configuration ==

When the default MediaWikiServices instance is created, a Config object is
provided to the constructor. This Config object represents the "bootstrap"
configuration which will become available as the 'BootstrapConfig' service.
As of MW 1.27, the bootstrap config is a GlobalVarConfig object providing
access to the $wgXxx configuration variables.

The bootstrap config is then used to construct a 'ConfigFactory' service,
which in turn is used to construct the 'MainConfig' service. Application
logic should use the 'MainConfig' service (or a more specific configuration
object). 'BootstrapConfig' should only be used for bootstrapping basic
services that are needed to load the 'MainConfig'.
