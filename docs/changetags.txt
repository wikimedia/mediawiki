Change tags are annotations appended to revisions, logged actions or recent
changes.

They are either defined at the software level, in core or by extensions, or
at the user level, by tag managers.

Software-defined tags are applied directly by mediawiki when the tagged
action is made, while user-defined tags are applied by users or bots when
the tagged action is made (provided they have the applychangetags permission),
or afterwards (provided they have the changetags permission).

Tag managers, i.e. users with the managechangetags permission, can
create new user-defined tags, deactivate them or activate them again,
provided they are not software-defined.
In addition, users with the deletechangetags permission can delete tags,
i.e. remove them from all revisions, logged actions and recent changes.

Extensions should use the ChangeTagsRegister hook to define tags.
