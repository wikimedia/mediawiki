GLOBALS.DOC

PHP loves globals. I hate them. This is not a great
combination, but I manage. I could get rid of most of
them by having a single "HTTP request" object, and using
it to hold everything that's now global (which is exactly
what I'd do in a Java servlet). But that's really
awkward in PHP, and wouldn't really provide much benefit
in readability or maintainability, so I go with the flow
of PHP and use globals.  Here's documentation on the
important globals used by the system.

$wgOut
	OutputPage object for HTTP response.

$wgTitle
	Title object created from the request URL.

$wgLang
	Language object for this request.

$wgArticle
	Article object corresponsing to $wgTitle.

$wgLinkCache
	LinkCache object.
