title.txt

The MediaWiki software's "Title" class represents article
titles, which are used for many purposes: as the human-readable
text title of the article, in the URL used to access the article,
the wikitext link to the article, the key into the article
database, and so on. The class in instantiated from one of
these forms and can be queried for the others, and for other
attributes of the title. This is intended to be an
immutable "value" class, so there are no mutator functions.

To get a new instance, call Title::newFromText(). Once instantiated, 
the non-static accessor methods can be used, such as getText(), 
getDBKey(), getNamespace(), etc. Note that Title::newFromText() may
return false if the text is illegal according to the rules below.

The prefix rules: a title consists of an optional interwiki
prefix (such as "m:" for meta or "de:" for German), followed
by an optional namespace, followed by the remainder of the
title. Both interwiki prefixes and namespace prefixes have
the same rules: they contain only letters, digits, space, and
underscore, must start with a letter, are case insensitive,
and spaces and underscores are interchangeable.  Prefixes end
with a ":". A prefix is only recognized if it is one of those
specifically allowed by the software. For example, "de:name"
is a link to the article "name" in the German Wikipedia, because
"de" is recognized as one of the allowable interwikis. The
title "talk:name" is a link to the article "name" in the "talk"
namespace of the current wiki, because "talk" is a recognized
namespace. Both may be present, and if so, the interwiki must
come first, for example, "m:talk:name". If a title begins with
a colon as its first character, no prefixes are scanned for,
and the colon is just removed. Note that because of these
rules, it is possible to have articles with colons in their
names. "E. Coli 0157:H7" is a valid title, as is "2001: A Space
Odyssey", because "E. Coli 0157" and "2001" are not valid
interwikis or namespaces.

It is not possible to have an article whose bare name includes
a namespace or interwiki prefix.

An initial colon in a title listed in wiki text may however
suppress special handling for interlanguage links, image links,
and category links. It is also used to indicate the main 
namespace in template inclusions.

Once prefixes have been stripped, the rest of the title processed 
this way: 

* Spaces and underscores are treated as equivalent and each 
is converted to the other in the appropriate context (underscore in 
URL and database keys, spaces in plain text). 
* Multiple consecutive spaces are converted to a single space.
* Leading or trailing space is removed.
* If $wgCapitalLinks is enabled (the default), the first letter is 
capitalised, using the capitalisation function of the content language
object.
* The unicode characters LRM (U+200E) and RLM (U+200F) are silently 
stripped.
* Invalid UTF-8 sequences or instances of the replacement character
(U+FFFD) are considered illegal.
* A percent sign followed by two hexadecimal characters is illegal
* Anything that looks like an XML/HTML character reference is illegal
* Any character not matched by the $wgLegalTitleChars regex is illegal
* Zero-length titles (after whitespace stripping) are illegal

All titles except special pages must be less than 255 bytes when
encoded with UTF-8, because that is the size of the database field.
Special page titles may be up to 512 bytes.

Note that Unicode Normal Form C (NFC) is enforced by MediaWiki's user
interface input functions, and so titles will typically be in this 
form. 

getArticleID() needs some explanation: for "internal" articles,
it should return the "page_id" field if the article exists, else
it returns 0. For all external articles it returns 0. All of
the IDs for all instances of Title created during a request are
cached, so they can be looked up quickly while rendering wiki
text with lots of internal links. See linkcache.txt.
