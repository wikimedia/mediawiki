api-query-continue.txt

When using API action=query, since 1.21 you can use the 'smart continue' mode.

In this mode, all 'continue' values are set in such a way as to minimize
client logic needed to optimally iterate over the resultset.

Assuming the client has the param=>value dictionary with the original request
parameters, client will only need to perform this operation in their language:

  $request = array_merge( $request, $result['query-continue'] );

before the next api call. The client should not be making any additional
request parameter modifications. The query is complete when the result has
no 'query-continue' section.
