The 'docs' directory contain various text files that should help you
understand the most importants classes in MediaWiki.

API documentation is sometime generated and uploaded at:
  http://wikipedia.sourceforge.net/doc/

You can get a fresh version using 'make doc' or mwdocgen.php
in the ../maintenance/ directory.



For end user / administrators, most of the documentation
is located online at:
  http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Help
